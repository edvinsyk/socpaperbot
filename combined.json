    "description": "Babies in the United States fare worse than their peers in other high-income countries, and their well-being is starkly unequal along socioeconomic and racialized lines. Newborn health predicts adult well-being, making these inequalities consequential. Policymakers and scholars seeking to improve newborn health and reduce inequality have recently looked to direct cash transfers as a viable intervention. We examine the only unconditional cash transfer in the United States, the Alaska Permanent Fund Dividend (PFD), to learn if giving pregnant people money improves their newborns\u2019 health. Alaska has paid its residents a significant dividend annually since 1982. The dividend\u2019s size varies yearly and is exogenous to Alaskans and the local economy, permitting us to make causal claims. After accounting for fertility selection, we find that receiving cash during pregnancy has no meaningful effect on newborn health. Current theory focuses on purchasing power and status mechanisms to delineate how money translates into health. It cannot illuminate this null finding. This case illustrates a weakness with current theory: it does not provide clear expectations for interventions. We propose four components that must be considered in tandem to predict whether proposed interventions will work.",

    "description": "How does work come to be constructed as a service to the worker? In the United States, the payment of subminimum wages to disabled workers has been legal since 1938 and was entrenched by 1986 legislation eliminating the previously mandated floor of 50 percent of the minimum wage. This article draws on primary historical materials to explain the passage of these amendments, which I analyze as a case of delaborization, a process through which work is mystified as such and reclassified as something else (e.g., service). I find that the managers of segregated workshops for disabled manual laborers rose to control disability employment policy in the aftermath of deinstitutionalization. Professionals mobilized disability stigma to frame the subminimum wage as a social welfare issue subject to their expertise and to lobby successfully for its entrenchment. Weaknesses in the disability\u2013labor coalition enabled this seizure of jurisdiction. This research illuminates professional expertise, the withdrawal of labor unions, and identity-based stigma as major mechanisms driving delaborization, an important contemporary influence on the organization of work. The case of the subminimum wage thus develops sociological literatures on labor, disability, and politics.",

    "description": "Lawmakers are routinely confronted by urgent social issues, yet they hold conflicting policy preferences, incentives, and goals that can undermine collaboration. How do lawmakers collaborate on solutions to urgent issues in the presence of conflicts? I argue that by building mutual trust, networks provide a mechanism to overcome the risks conflict imposes on policy collaboration. But, in doing so, network dependence constrains lawmakers\u2019 ability to react to the problems that motivate policy action beyond their immediate connections. I test this argument using machine learning and longitudinal analysis of federal crime legislation co-sponsorship networks between 1979 and 2005, a period of rising political elite polarization. Results show that elite polarization increased the effects of reciprocal action and prior collaboration on crime legislation co-sponsorships while suppressing the effect of violent crime rates. These relationships vary only marginally by political party and are pronounced for ratified criminal laws. The findings provide new insights to the role of collaboration networks in the historical development of the carceral state and elucidate how political actors pursue collective policy action on urgent issues in the presence of conflict.",

    "description": "Recent religious declines in the United States are for a large part driven by the growing number of Americans who were raised religiously but left religion in the transition to adulthood. Nonetheless, their views and behaviors may still be influenced by their religious upbringing. We explore such legacy effects by examining how changing religiosity during the transition to adulthood influences volunteering among young adults. Analyzing panel data from the National Study of Youth and Religion, we estimate two types of effects: effects of cumulative religious trajectories in youth, and effects of religiosity in youth that are not mediated by religiosity in adulthood. We find that histories of religious involvement shape volunteering in adulthood, but the precise nature of such effects varies across dimensions of religiosity and types of volunteering. Religious service attendance in youth promotes volunteering in adulthood mostly indirectly, through influencing religiosity in adulthood, and exclusively for activities organized by religious groups. By contrast, religious identification in youth promotes volunteering in adulthood also through other channels, and its effects on secular volunteering may persist even when people are not religious in adulthood. We discuss the implications of these findings in light of ongoing declines in religiosity in the United States.",

    "description": "Lynching remains a common form of collective punishment for alleged wrongdoers in Latin America, Africa, and Asia today. Unlike other kinds of collective violence, lynching is usually not carried out by standing organizations. How do lynch mobs overcome the high barriers to violent collective action? I argue that they draw on local community ties to compensate for a lack of centralized organization. Lynch mobs benefit from solidarity and peer pressure, which facilitate collective action. The study focuses on Mexico, where lynching is prevalent and often amounts to the collective beating of thieves. Based on original survey data from Mexico City and a novel lynching event dataset covering the whole of Mexico, I find that individuals with more ties in their communities participate more often in lynching, and municipalities with more highly integrated communities have higher lynching rates. As community ties and lynching may be endogenously related, I also examine the posited mechanisms and the causal direction. Findings reveal that municipalities exposed to a recent major earthquake\u2014an event that tends to increase community ties\u2014subsequently experienced increased levels of lynching. Importantly, I find that interpersonal trust is unrelated to lynching, thus showing that different aspects of social capital have diverging consequences for collective violence, with community ties revealing a \u201cdark side.\u201d",

    "description": "Cultural capital is a central concept in stratification research. Crucial to the Bourdieusian habitus, upper strata familiarity with the dominant culture is assumed to be ingrained via socialization, allowing its members to smoothly navigate educational institutions and higher segments of the labor market. Although cultural capital is deemed partially implicit, such \u201cnon-declarative\u201d or \u201cembodied\u201d cultural capital has largely escaped empirical scrutiny; arguments about its importance are typically post hoc interpretations of associations between measures of declarative cultural capital (survey items on elite cultural consumption) and variables of interest. To advance stratification research, we developed tools to empirically capture non-declarative cultural capital: Implicit Association Tests (IATs) measuring (1) positive association and (2) self-identification with elite culture, embedded in a survey fielded among a high-quality panel representative of the Dutch population (n\u2009=\u20092,436). We find our IATs validly measure non-declarative cultural capital. As expected, scores are only weakly coupled with declarative cultural capital, and associated with (parental) socioeconomic position. Using these IATs liberates non-declarative cultural capital from its deus ex machina status and answers the black-box critique of the Bourdieusian habitus as an explanation for socially stratified patterns across a range of fields.",

    "description": "Why do elite professionals leave hard-earned, privileged corporate careers? This article examines an underappreciated case of employee turnover, white-collar opt-out, which involves resignations that may not immediately lead to a similar job or life experience, but are instead followed by alternatives to fast-track careers, including seeking another occupation, stay-at-home parenting, or pursuit of leisure and self-exploration. Drawing on 70 in-depth interviews with Turkish professional-managerial employees of transnational corporations located in both Istanbul and New York City, I examine their narratives about the quality of working life and their decisions to opt out through the lenses of worker consent and alienation. I identify the lack of work-life balance and fulfillment with one\u2019s labor as drivers of opting out, showing how these push factors, combined with various pull factors of non-working life and safety nets, encourage elite workers to overcome status anxiety and abandon corporate careers. The article extends labor process theory insights into high-paying corporate occupations, illuminating how so-called \u201cgood jobs\u201d may produce a relatively low quality of working life. It also exposes the inherent limits of resource-centered approaches to inequality, showing how alienating work can undermine the quality of life of even upwardly mobile, high-skilled workers.",

This article recounts my sociological adventures, from efforts to understand the world as I found it in the early 1960s to my responses to current reactionary trends.

Our review of this interdisciplinary scholarship describes the range of views people hold, the attitudes and behaviors associated with them, and what factors contribute to these views. We focus primarily on essentialism and constructivism, although we describe the greater variety of beliefs beyond this dichotomy, as well as fluidity in how people use these concepts.

We focus on a selective subset of contributions aligning with four broad topics: causal effect identification and estimation in general, causal effect heterogeneity, causal effect mediation, and temporal and spatial interference. We describe how machine learning, as an estimation strategy, can be effectively combined with causal inference, which has been traditionally concerned with identification. The incorporation of machine learning in causal inference enables researchers to better address potential biases in estimating causal effects and uncover heterogeneous causal effects. Uncovering sources of effect heterogeneity is key for generalizing to populations beyond those under study. While sociology has long emphasized the importance of causal mechanisms, historical and life-cycle variation, and social contexts involving network interactions, recent conceptual and computational advances facilitate more principled estimation of causal effects under these settings. We encourage sociologists to incorporate these insights into their empirical research.",

Then the role of cultural objects in stabilizing and destabilizing meaning and social arrangements is discussed.

Our framework presents age as a system of inequality that can be understood through concepts and processes that operate at multiple levels of analysis. At the individual level, we argue age is best conceptualized and operationalized as multidimensional. We review a range of measures, from birth cohort to physical appearance, that can be fruitfully combined in empirical research to account for this complexity.

This article provides a guide to this scholarship. We show how the political nature of cross-border movements creates and circumscribes conditions for diasporic political mobilization. We then identify the different types of cross-border political activities and the modalities of corresponding home state policies.

    "description": "The doctoral dissertation often shapes the career that follows it, influencing both opportunities encountered and research conducted. This article describes the ways this has been true for me and then argues that, given the dissertation's importance, graduate programs do not focus sufficiently on strategies for conceiving research. As a result, many students flounder at the dissertation proposal stage. Drawing on the role of doubt in my career and in science more generally, I propose changes in doctoral programs to reduce the problem.",

    "description": "Recent years have witnessed a surge of interest in artificial intelligence (AI). To address AI\u2019s growing visibility and importance, the authors edited a special collection that showcases cutting-edge sociological research on AI in areas such as health and medicine, work and labor, new research methodologies, and policy. The articles collectively position AI as a sociotechnical system, recognizing that AI integrates heterogeneous elements that intertwine the social and the technical. Each article brings different aspects of sociotechnical systems to light. The authors highlight three contributions sociologists are poised to make to the study of AI: (1) critical analysis of AI hype, promotion, and adoption; (2) empirical study of AI\u2019s co-constitution with processes of social life; and (3) identification of avenues for structural change in creating equitable AI futures. The authors call for the development of novel research methods to study distributed AI platforms and for future research on inequalities, power, and data justice.",

    "description": "Although we now know that disaster and climate migration is complex and nonlinear, less is known about how migrants from environmentally threatened areas are affected by disasters back home. This study centers the perspectives and care of 30 migrants from several high-risk coastal Louisiana communities who helped their kin in the wake of Hurricane Ida (2021). In fusing the disaster migration and disaster care literature, it illustrates how migrants engage in gendered care work from afar. It also shows how gender shapes decision making to stay in or stay attached to such environments and even perpetuates the need for future care. The theoretical concept of a \u201cdisaster carescape\u201d is proposed to highlight intergenerational care across time and space while emphasizing place (environmentally threatened landscapes) and place attachment in shaping these care relations. The author concludes by suggesting that disaster carescapes will be important to understand as demographics in climate-affected areas shift during this century.",

Using a unique survey experiment with a demographically representative sample of 1,032 individuals, the authors examine how negative feedback mechanisms, a critical aspect of the online environment, affect men\u2019s and women\u2019s intention to participate in these discussions. The authors focus on two feedback mechanisms: dislike and deletion. The findings suggest that dislike does not discourage women from participating in online political discussions. However, women show significantly lower participation intentions when their posts risk deletion. In contrast, men\u2019s participation intentions are not deterred by either feedback mechanism. These findings suggest that context-specific feedback mechanisms are important in understanding the gender gap in online political participation, emphasizing women\u2019s sensitivity to online environments where their contributions might be erased.",

The hypothesis is based on the tendency of first- and second-generation immigrants to exhibit higher levels of religiosity compared with the host populations. Simulation analysis involving more than 15,000 respondents of data from the 2014 to 2021 German General Social Survey indicates that the increase in the immigrant population during this period does not emerge as a substantial counterforce to religious decline in both eastern and western Germany. An effective slowdown of secularization in Germany would have required a more substantial increase in immigration, a notably higher level of religious engagement among new arrivals and their descendants than was observed, and a reduced pace of secularization among them.",

I find that, on average, trust and support are lower among cost-related movers. My findings suggest that cost-related movers might be less trusting because they tend to be more wary of strangers, which could include their neighbors. They further suggest that cost-related movers might be less likely to have neighbors they can count on for support because they are more likely to perceive their neighborhoods as unsafe.

Men in state firms report significantly higher odds of preferring to lay off women first, but this effect is even stronger in private firms. As symbols of economic stability, state firms are prohibited from conducting layoffs, creating insulated organizational cultures with traditional gender role beliefs that are resistant to change. Meanwhile, private firms are governed by a firm logic of profit maximization that creates more precarity among workers and compels them, men and even women, to embrace layoffs of fellow women workers to protect themselves.",

    "description": "Throughout its history, the real estate industry has emphasized privacy and exclusion in housing advertisements, helping entrench patterns of residential segregation in the process. Recently, however, some forms of neighborhood-level social diversity are becoming more common, as indicated by the growing number of neighborhoods that are mixed-income. Does the proliferation of income-diverse neighborhoods suggest that advertisers are curtailing their exclusionary rhetoric when marketing homes in mixed-income communities? To answer this question, this study analyzes over one million Craigslist rental listings posted in the 100 largest U.S. metropolitan areas in July and August of 2019. Findings show that real estate advertisers continue to rely on rhetorical strategies that likely reinforce, if not encourage, privacy and exclusion in mixed-income neighborhoods. Specifically, rental advertisements in mixed-income neighborhoods were disproportionately likely to mention that the advertised unit came with a home security device, a rhetorical tool likely aimed at calming homeseekers\u2019 apprehension toward living in an income-diverse neighborhood. This finding suggests that scholars have underexamined the strategies that real estate actors use to persuade homeseekers to live in diverse neighborhoods. Furthermore, the security rhetoric prevalent in income-diverse neighborhoods may encourage homeseekers\u2019 fears of mixed-income settings and impede cross-class social integration.",

The authors orient sociologists to the rapidly evolving AI policy landscape by defining AI and by contrasting two leading approaches to AI governance: a safety-based and an equity-based approach. The authors argue that the safety-based approach is the predominant one but is inadequate. They suggest that sociologists can shift AI policymaking to prioritize equity by examining corporate political power in AI policy debates and by organizing research around four sociological questions centered on equity and public engagement.

The authors argue that public redistribution affects the level of net wealth by moderating the household-level association of income and wealth. Drawing on microdata for 14 countries from the Luxembourg Wealth Study, and spending and revenue data from the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development, the authors use ordinary least squares models with country fixed effects. The authors find a positive moderation effect of social spending and a negative moderation effect of income taxation. Higher and lower labor incomes translate into higher and lower levels of wealth where income taxation is lower or social spending is higher. The authors complement these findings with panel information from the United States, providing further evidence supporting the cross-national results. In summary, public redistribution partially accounts for differences in the association of income and wealth across countries. The authors urge future research on the correlation of income and wealth to take public redistribution into account.",

Experimental surveys uncover subconscious same-gender preferences in advice receptivity, contrasting with stated desires for gender-neutral guidance. These implicit affinities persist even when advice content is anonymized and gender-balanced. Paradoxically, finfluencers introduce diverse voices and challenge traditional norms yet also subtly cater to gendered perspectives.

Black and Latino workers are overrepresented in high-strain jobs at many ages, compared with other groups. Exposure to job strain across working ages shows more variation in exposure by gender and race/ethnicity groups than static measures.

Results uncover how AI designers use narratives around missing data on vulnerable populations as justifications for the creation of synthetic data that were artificially manufactured rather than generated by real-world events. Although this was a profitable business model for AI companies, these practices ultimately situated long-term care residents as voiceless in the development of AI.

I show that Democratic party power, higher political spending from environmental organizations, lower investor-owned utility market share, higher publicly owned utility market share, and lower levels of fossil fuel production and political spending lead to more stringent policies. In contrast, weaker policies are more likely in states where the prototypical opponents of climate policy, Republican politicians and oil and gas interests, have greater power.",

    "description": "During the COVID-19 pandemic, nonbinary and genderfluid adults did information work to discover their gender identities as they explored information on social media, online, and in person. Due to cisnormative restrictions, this information was necessary to identify and validate their gender identity as authentic. During the pandemic, more nonbinary people were able to self-recognize their own gender because there was more time for reflection and more access to nonbinary narratives online, including representations of nonbinary life that defied White, thin, androgynous ideals. By analyzing interviews with 22 U.S. adults who came out as nonbinary during the pandemic, this qualitative study contributes to both the sociological study of nonbinary identity development and to the information science literature on deeply meaningful and profoundly personal information work. This study also contributes to further understanding of why it seems like more nonbinary and genderfluid people \u201ccame out\u201d during the height of the pandemic.",

We revisit DiMaggio and Powell and examine the shift in isomorphic behaviors that occur during a crisis, illustrating how shocks result in the use of nontraditional practices. We empirically examine the impact of the 2008 economic crisis on U.S. art museums\u2019 isomorphic referent transitions in the use of market practices before and after the crisis, covering 2006 to 2011. Our findings indicate that museums altered the scope of mimetic isomorphism, and as a result, U.S. art museums sought solutions by shifting reference groups that were structurally (leader vs. peer), physically (geographical region), or organizational (social networks) proximate during the crisis. We elaborate our understanding of isomorphic behavior as a key factor during times of crisis that destabilized institutional environments, both symbolic and resource spaces. This finding can be generalized to other organizational settings beyond art museums.",

    "description": "Our study reevaluates the impact of commuting on mental health, challenging the prevailing view of commuting solely as a job-related demand or stressor that leads to increased mental health problems. Using the 2011 Neighbourhood Effects on Health and Well-Being Study from Toronto, we explore the dual perspectives of commuting distance as a stressful demand versus a potentially beneficial resource among parents of minor children (n\u2009=\u2009299). Multivariate results reveal that commuting distance alone is not significantly linked to mental health as measured by psychological distress. However, the nature of commuting\u2014whether it is viewed as a demand or a resource\u2014depends on other factors in parents\u2019 lives. Specifically, our results indicate that an increase in commuting distance exacerbates the negative effects of work hours on psychological distress while simultaneously buffering against the impact of work-to-family conflict on this outcome irrespective of gender.",

Ratings of adolescent facial attractiveness are predictive of later life outcomes among women, but mainly because ratings of young women\u2019s attractiveness are closely connected with women\u2019s socioeconomic standing and body mass in early life. The same is not true for men.

In particular, the authors examine how the interplay between artists\u2019 collaborations and shared references changed throughout Hollywood\u2019s history. Using data from the Internet Movie Database and applying relational hyperevent models, the authors analyze the coevolution of collaboration and reference networks among 15,553 Hollywood film professionals who participated in 6,800 films between 1930 and 1999. The authors complement prior sociological efforts through a longitudinal perspective on the structure of social and stylistic networks across three meaningful historical periods: before, during, and after Hollywood\u2019s artistic transformation in the 1960s. The findings show that filmmakers are more likely to collaborate if they previously used the same references, but they are less likely to adopt the references of their previous collaborators. In addition, the results highlight that the structure of relational processes in cultural fields varies over time as the contextual conditions for tie formation change.",

Drawing on ethnographic research and interviews, the author analyzes how digital psychiatry researchers become \u201cmoral entrepreneurs,\u201d actors who wield their social influence to define ethical conduct, through two practices. First, researchers engage in moral discovery, identifying gaps in regulation as opportunities to articulate ethical standards.

With these techniques, digital psychiatry researchers demonstrate ethical innovation is essential to their professional identity. Yet ultimately, the author demonstrates how moral entrepreneurship erects barriers to participation in ethical decision making and constrains the focus of ethical consideration.",

    "description": "Drawing on ethnographic, interview, and textual data with researchers creating machine learning solutions for health care, the author explains how researchers justify their projects while grappling with uncertainties about the benefits and harms of machine learning. Researchers differentiate between a hypothesized world of machine learning and a \u201creal\u201d world of clinical practice. Each world relates to distinct frameworks for describing, evaluating, and reconciling uncertainties. In the hypothesized world, impacts are hypothetical. They can be operationalized, controlled, and computed as bias and fairness. In the real world, impacts address patient outcomes in clinical settings. Real impacts are chaotic and uncontrolled and relate to complex issues of equity. To address real-world uncertainties, researchers collaborate closely with clinicians, who explain real-world implications, and participate in data generation projects to improve clinical datasets. Through these collaborations, researchers expand ethical discussions, while delegating moral responsibility to clinicians and medical infrastructure. This preserves the legitimacy of machine learning as a pure, technical domain, while allowing engagement with health care impacts. This article contributes an explanation of the interplay between technical and moral boundaries in shaping ethical dilemmas and responsibilities, and explains the significance of collaboration in artificial intelligence projects for ethical engagement.",

Between-workplace closure mechanisms tend to be absent or weak for all comparisons, but within-workplace occupational closure and within-job pay disparities are present for all and quite large for most groups. Within-job earnings inequalities tend to be largest for Black, Hispanic, and Native American women and smallest for Asian and Native American men.

Among Hispanic White individuals, a presumed immigrant-dominant group, there is no age at which the majority of members are foreign born. Alternatively, among non-Hispanic Asians and Pacific Islanders, Hispanics from other races, and multiracial Hispanics, there is a clear divide between majority foreign-born and majority native-born age groups.

    "description": "Scholars have linked income inequality to the recent success of radical-right parties and movements. Yet research shows that inequality reduces participation among groups likely to support the radical right and promotes support for redistribution, an issue championed by the radical left. This raises questions about why, if at all, inequality matters for radical-right politics. The author reconciles previous arguments by developing a theory that connects these phenomena through the process of boundary consolidation. He argues that inequality generates status threats that prompt exclusionary shifts in national group boundaries. This promotes ethnonationalism, a restrictive conception of national membership and, ultimately, support for the radical right, whose mobilization relies on ethnonationalist appeals. Analyses of time-series cross-sectional data from 38 countries support this theory, revealing that inequality is associated with greater ethnonationalism, with distinct associations by income and ethnicity, and that ethnonationalism strongly predicts radical-right voting. The author thus demonstrates how long-term structural changes are linked to contemporary radical politics and how arguments setting economic and cultural causes of the radical right in opposition are inadequate.",

    "description": "Studies of social capital usually emphasize its prosocial, deviance-reducing effects. This article instead explores its negative potential. The authors focus on the relationship between different forms of community-level social capital and tax avoidance by wealthy Americans, using data from the Panama Papers leaks to analyze the residential communities of Americans who engaged in offshore tax avoidance. The analysis demonstrates, first, that communities with more civic organizations are more likely to have tax avoiders. This finding suggests that civic organizations may promote cohesion among wealthy elites, producing insular attitudes and deviance. Second, income inequality correlates with tax avoidance, indicating that highly unequal communities have more insular elites. Finally, more patriotic communities have lower tax avoidance. These findings empirically establish the concept of \u201cnegative social capital\u201d and advance the distinction between bridging (or cross-group) social capital, which lowers deviance, and bonding (or within-group) social capital, which is actually associated with greater elite deviance.",

    "description": "Trans people\u2019s gender identity is frequently cited as a source of health care denial, even when it has no bearing on their symptom presentation. A latent belief among health care workers that trans people are fundamentally different from cis people is deeply implicated in the finding that between one fifth and one third of trans people have been denied care because of their gender identity. In this study, the authors use data from a nationally representative survey (n\u2009=\u20092,458) to examine whether Americans believe a doctor who denies care to a trans patient on the basis of claims of inadequate training. The authors find a majority of Americans trust this explanation. These views are more common among Evangelicals and Republicans, whereas Black respondents are less inclined to deem this justification valid. Qualitative analyses reveal that those who accept the doctor\u2019s rationale are more likely to acquiesce to doctors\u2019 medical knowledge, to assert that doctors have professional discretion in making referrals, and to reference complications stemming from the patient\u2019s presumed receipt of gender-affirming care despite the routine nature of their sick visit. These findings indicate that doctors\u2019 enduring cultural authority powerfully intersects with \u201ctrans exceptionalism\u201d to inform Americans\u2019 perspectives on the denial of care to trans people.",

Jails are the front door of the criminal legal system and admit millions of people each year. Yet jails have received little attention in sociological research, and existing research tends to focus on large, urban facilities. Here the author analyzes panel data organized at the county-year level to depict variation in four measures of jail incarceration across the rural-urban continuum since 1978. The author finds that jail incarceration rates have tended to increase across the period, but the urban incarceration rate has declined since 2007 as the rural incarceration rate continues to increase. Most people in jail are legally innocent and have not been convicted of a crime, and the Black/white disparity in jail incarceration has decreased over time.",

Is this because, until recently, immigrant protest was minimal or limited in scope? The authors take a macro-comparative approach, recoding the Dynamics of Collective Action dataset to compare proimmigrant collective action with paradigmatic, well-studied movements from 1960 to 1995. The authors find that immigrant collective action was on par with iconic movements, mobilized similar numbers of people, occurred across the United States, engaged in disruptive action, and encompassed a wide range of origins, thus correcting possible misperceptions that immigrants did not engage in contentious action before the 1990s. The authors conclude by advocating for a population at risk focus for studying the emergence of collective action, decentering the borders of collective mobilization, and illuminating the vulnerabilities of legal status.",

The authors examine three sources of emotional support (friends, family, and partners) and their association with three mental health outcomes (depression, anxiety, and loneliness) separately for cisgender men and cisgender women. The authors find that emotional support plays a larger role in the association between sexual identity and mental health for cisgender men than cisgender women. Regardless of gender, bisexual individuals have consistently higher levels of depression, anxiety, and loneliness across all models, and this difference is not attenuated by emotional support.",

Using an original survey of Canadian women (n\u2009=\u20091,181), the authors examine religious affiliation and attendance, abortion attitudes, and self-reported abortion experience.

The increased use of fines and fees has been likened to a predatory system that exploits the most vulnerable groups to fill state and local budget gaps. States have begun limiting suspensions for unpaid traffic tickets out of economic and racial equity concerns, but many still sanction drivers for failing to appear in court or comply with other regulations. Merging the full universe of New York Department of Motor Vehicles suspension records in 2017 with the American Community Survey at the zip code level, we find that Black, Hispanic, and economically disadvantaged communities were disproportionately impacted by both nonpayment and noncompliance suspensions. Predictive models suggest that reforms ending suspensions for both the failure to appear in traffic court and the failure to pay traffic tickets could substantially reduce these disparities.",

    "description": "On the one hand, previous research argues that growth in rural populations leads to forest loss from clearing trees to make room for the growing population and their farming needs. On the other hand, research is also concerned with how deforestation drives people out of rural areas, leading to overurbanization. From this work, it is clear that the movement of people has an important relationship to forest loss, but it is less clear what the autonomy of people is in this process. Put differently, more focus has been put on state-level economic and environmental factors than political factors when considering the impact of domestic migration on forest loss. Although there has been substantial work on how political factors, like democracy, impact forest loss, there is less research on how political rights, like freedom of domestic movement, may impact forest loss. To build on this research, we test the impact of freedom of domestic movement and democracy on forest loss from 2001 to 2014 for a sample of 107 low- and middle-income nations. We find support for the idea that having more freedom of movement decreases forest loss in more democratic nations compared to less democratic nations. We also find that both rural and urban population growth, among others, is associated with higher levels of forest loss. Together, our findings suggest that the freedom of domestic movement should be taken into consideration in addition to population growth from actual domestic movement when researching forest loss.",

The authors applied an innovative research design to underscore different sources of selection. Overall, no concrete evidence was found for the positive effect of teleworking on workers\u2019 self-reported health, quality of sleep, and psychosomatic conditions. The ostensible better health outcomes among teleworkers could be partially explained by the positive selection on both prior levels and prior trajectories of health into teleworking. Moreover, the health impacts of telework were contingent on workers\u2019 gender and parenthood status and the intensity of teleworking. These findings indicate that the positive association between teleworking and health appears to reflect selection bias rather than a causal relationship in Germany before the COVID-19 pandemic.",

I implement a multiregional input-output approach to operationalize these emission components. Using the MEP framework and dynamic fixed-effects models with the seemingly unrelated regression estimator, I find these four emission components are heterogeneously related to national affluence in high-income nations. As these nations become even wealthier, affluence is gradually decoupled from emissions generated by domestic-oriented supply chain activities and direct end-user emissions, yet it remains strongly coupled with the other two emission components in distinct ways.

However, following these events, a positive association emerged between support for anti-gay views and anti-Ukrainian sentiment.

Multilevel models analyzing Demographic and Health Survey Program data on women from 50 low- and middle-income countries emphasize the collision of global scripts with local constraints: In low contraceptive contexts, education is associated with higher risk of unintended pregnancy.

    "description": "Few researchers have considered how gentrification affects inequalities of housing wealth between Black and White neighborhoods. Drawing on the U.S. census and the American Community Survey, I test the hypothesis that home values rise more slowly in gentrifying neighborhoods that are majority Black compared to those that are majority White. I find that home values appreciate more quickly in gentrifying neighborhoods that are majority Black, particularly those that are experiencing significant change in their racial-ethnic composition. The findings further suggest that Black gentrifying neighborhoods experiencing racial transition\u2014a large increase in the proportion of White residents and a large decrease in the proportion of Black residents\u2014experience higher rates of home value appreciation than those not experiencing racial transition. I argue that gentrification reproduces the racial stratification of urban neighborhoods because large increases to housing wealth tend to be coupled with the arrival of the White middle-class.",

For young people, the relationship between feminism and support for transgender women is unequivocally positive. Among older people, by contrast, feminists are polarized. They are more likely than nonfeminists to strongly support trans women but also more likely to strongly oppose them. Whether this polarization is peculiar to Britain, where the transgender movement has met with particularly strong countermobilization, is a question for future research.",

    "description": "The timing of childbirth has undergone significant changes in the past decades. However, it may not be feasible for individuals with many children to further delay the timing of each childbirth given the biological constraints on fecundability and social age deadline for childbirth. Thus, the delay in having children and the increasing heterogeneity in its timing may present different trends when analyzed retrospectively by completed number of children. This study investigates the age at childbirth by birth order among women age 40+ in 17 European countries and Canada based on the number of children they have. Our findings show that individuals having more children tend to have each child at earlier ages, with less variation in timing, compared to the counterparts with fewer children. This suggests that changes in the timing of childbirth are more pronounced among individuals having fewer children and less so among those with having more children.",

    "description": "Research on populist attitudes and populist leaders\u2019 narratives has largely overlooked what happens to populist attitudes after a populist is elected, especially among the populist\u2019s supporters. Existing literature points to two possible directions of change. On one hand, if populist attitudes stem from a perceived lack of representation, then we would expect people\u2019s populist attitudes to decrease once their preferred candidate is in power. On the other hand, scholars have observed that populist politicians in power continue to deploy populist rhetoric, suggesting that their supporters\u2019 populist attitudes should stay constant or even increase. In this project, the author focuses on Donald Trump and his supporters to explore this mechanism. Drawing on a national survey conducted around the 2016 and 2020 elections, the author shows that Trump\u2019s supporters saw a significant decrease in populist attitudes after he came into power compared with both other American voters and other Republicans. The author also demonstrates that this decrease in populist attitudes is associated with changes in the level of \u201cfeeling represented.\u201d On the basis of these findings, the author argues that populist attitudes are driven by feelings of lack of representation over other mechanisms.",

Drawing on 32 interviews and nine months of fieldwork in Tokyo, the author describes how one of the largest foreign conversation schools in Japan (NOVA) has invested in broadcasting whiteness and English skill as traits of authentic native speakers. This process depends on who is viewed as a valuable teacher, but it also depends on migrants who pursue life in Japan through language teaching. Work at NOVA is highly exploitative. Yet because most of the workforce has ulterior motivations, they are willing to exchange substandard work for the privilege of mobility. This case highlights the overlaps between lifestyle migration and native speakerism at the organizational level and how supposedly \u201cwin-win\u201d arrangements with labor create an enduring, material setting for the reproduction of ideology.",

The authors find no differences in the influence of birth spacing on the likelihood of returning to an employer versus changing employers but that shorter birth spacings relate to lower likelihoods of returning to the labor market. There is some evidence that birth spacing and postbirth employment varies by age at first birth, marital status, and occupation. Overall, the results suggest that although birth spacing is relevant for returning postbirth to employment, job changes are unlikely to drive mothers\u2019 wage penalties.",

Our findings confirm that all types of polarization increase engagement, but party affiliation plays an important role in the process. Polarizing rhetoric from Republicans generally elicits a stronger reaction relative to that from Democrats. The exception is an increase in retweets of issue-based polarization when posted by Democrats.

The authors analyze four restricted-use national survey datasets to investigate racial disparities in college attendance outcomes from the 1980s through the 2010s. Although college entrance rates increased for all racial groups, Black and Hispanic youth became increasingly less likely than their White peers to attend four-year selective colleges.

Drawing on a national probability survey collected in 2021 (n\u2009=\u20093,390), the authors find that individuals who draw boundaries between religion and science had higher odds of rejecting biological and social explanations of mental health conditions, whereas individuals who see religion and science as collaborative had higher odds of affirming biological and social explanations.

However, an increase in White residents, but not necessarily an increase in high\u2013socioeconomic status residents, is strongly associated with greater propensities.

Using latent class analysis on longitudinal data from the National Health and Aging Trends Study, the authors identify five distinct care network types: spousal care, care exclusively from children, care from both children and other sources, self-care with assistive technology, and care exclusively from nonfamily sources. Further analysis, including multinomial logistic regression and latent transition analysis, reveals that when a spouse is available, older adults, particularly older men, are more likely to rely on spousal care. However, in cases in which spouses and/or children are unavailable, older adults are inclined to turn to diverse care networks involving nontraditional caregivers or resort to self-care using assistive technologies. Additionally, declining health conditions are associated with a higher likelihood of receiving care from more varied care networks.

To help illuminate these factors, future research should explore whether the counties with high shares of couples but low shares of same-sex couples are also areas where inclusivity tends to be lagging.",

    "description": "Online enrollments in public universities have soared, in part because of universities\u2019 increasing reliance on for-profit online program managers (OPMs) for everything from instructional design to student recruitment. However, scholarship has indicated that OPMs may play a role in producing predatory forms of inclusion in higher education for marginalized students. To identify mechanisms through which this might occur, the authors conduct a mixed-methods analysis of 161 contracts between OPMs and two- and four-year public universities, an original database of third-party financing structure, and university webpages. The analysis identifies several contract features\u2014targeting, extraction, opacity, and captivity\u2014that may help concentrate marginalized students in extractive or exploitative online programs at public universities. The authors also show that OPMs funded by private equity or venture capital are most likely to include contract features that incentivize aggressive revenue production and promote the recruitment of marginalized students in online, but not in-person, programs.",

    "description": "AbstractScholars and policymakers are increasingly interested in subjective well-being as a development indicator. However, sociological research on this topic is quite limited, as is research that considers the effects of the biophysical environment on subjective well-being. In this study, we address these gaps in the literature by examining social and environmental influences on life satisfaction, a core component of subjective well-being. We employed multi-level regression analysis using data from over 97,000 individuals living across ninety-six countries. The results demonstrated significant effects of several individual-level variables on life satisfaction, in particular respondents\u2019 satisfaction with their local air and water quality and the efforts being made to preserve the environment in their country, as well as numerous social variables, such as income, gender, and employment status. Among the country-level variables, national gross domestic product per capita was positively associated with higher individual life satisfaction. Income inequality had a negative effect on life satisfaction, while wealth inequality, on the other hand, had a positive effect, a surprising finding we contemplate in some detail. The carbon intensity of a nation\u2019s economy as well as the proportion of a nation\u2019s land in protected areas only influenced life satisfaction when not controlling for the other variables. We conclude by discussing the implications of this research for sustainable development, including the promise of life satisfaction and other measures of subjective well-being as sustainable development indicators.",

    "description": "AbstractSocial movement theory holds that disrupting social and political processes is among the most effective tools social movement organizations (SMOs) use to motivate recognition for themselves and their constituents. Yet, recent research suggests that the political reception of disruption is not racially neutral. Black SMOs face a dilemma in that, although disruption is a powerful tool for change, the public often perceives nonviolent Black disruptive protest as violent. We investigate this bind by analyzing how nondisruptive protest, nonviolent disruption, or violence helps or hinders both Black and non-Black SMOs to gain state \u201cacceptance\u201d as legitimate spokes-organizations for their issues. We combine data on newspaper-reported protest events with data covering 41,545 SMO Congressional testimonies from 1462 SMOs from 35 movement families. In panel regressions, we find that Congress is generally more accepting of nondisruptive protest but that nondisruptive protest is only roughly one-tenth as effective for Black SMOs compared with non-Black SMOs. Furthermore, whereas non-Black SMOs are significantly more likely to testify after using nonviolent disruption, Black SMOs using nonviolent disruption are significantly less likely to testify before Congress. Regardless of race, violence was associated with fewer congressional testimonies. Collectively, these findings suggest that Black SMOs face a tactical bind: Black SMOs can use nondisruptive tactics that are resource-intensive and slow, or they can use nonviolent disruption that gets media attention but hinders congressional acceptance. These findings contribute to a growing literature on how racial inequality and prejudice impact the outcomes of social movements.",

Despite its prominence in public and political discourse, however, there is no systemic evidence on the levels and patterns of school segregation.

Using the 2021 Annual School Survey\u2014an administrative dataset covering all South African schools\u2014and the 2019 Trends in International Mathematics and Science Study school survey, we find very high levels of school segregation along racial as well as socioeconomic lines. White students almost exclusively attend former White schools, have little exposure to the low-income Black majority, and are vastly overrepresented in elite public and private schools. We argue that in South Africa and other contexts with under-resourced education systems, elite capture of the few high-performing schools serves to reproduce race and class privilege.",

    "description": "AbstractThe etiology of psychological differences among those who pursue distinct lines of work have long been of scholarly interest. A prevalent early and continuing assumption is that experiences on the job influence psychological development; contemporary analysts focus on dimensions indicative of mental health. Still, such work-related psychological differences may instead be attributable to selection processes to the extent that individuals can choose, or be selected to, different lines of work, based on their prior characteristics. Whereas much attention has been directed to employment per se as a key determinant of mental health, we consider work status (employed or not) and hours of work, as well as work quality, including both intrinsic and extrinsic dimensions among those who are employed. We also investigate differences in the effects of work experiences on mental health in distinct phases of the work career. Drawing on eleven waves of longitudinal data obtained from a cohort of ninth grade students followed prospectively to age 45\u201346 (54% female; 73% white), we examine whether key psychological dimensions indicative of mental health (mastery, depressive affect, and self-esteem) change in response to employment and to particular experiences on the job. The findings, based on a fixed-effects modeling strategy, indicate that observed psychological differences related to employment and work quality are not attributable to stable individual proclivities. Evidence suggests that mental health is responsive to changing experiences at work from mid-adolescence to mid-life.",

    "description": "AbstractThe mortgage industry is central to ethno-racial stratification in homeownership access. Ample research demonstrates that unequal treatment of minorities has created major differences in the access and exclusion of low-cost loan products in the housing market. While numerous studies have documented the disadvantages Black and Latino homebuyers face, these studies have been limited in their assessment of credit worthiness in accessing a mortgage. This study draws on the annual dataset from the Home Mortgage Disclosure Act from 2018 and 2019 to assess ethno-racial disparities in mortgage outcomes by debt-to-income (DTI) levels. I demonstrate that DTI levels vary tremendously by ethno-racial groups. In addition, I show that loan rejections and high-cost loan originations are highest among Blacks and Latinos across DTI levels compared to White applicants. Depending on the adverse loan outcome, Asians perform similarly or slightly underperform compared to Whites. These trends are particularly true when examining high-cost loan originations as Blacks and Latinos with excellent credit worthiness perform similarly as Whites and Asians with below-average credit worthiness. Implications for ethno-racial stratification are discussed.",

I constructed an original dataset of decisions of corruption cases at the Brazilian Superior Court of Justice (2003\u20132016).

Drawing on 110 interviews with prosecutors and judges and document analysis of criminal charges and judicial decisions, I show that case-focused protests affect judicial behavior through two mechanisms: by threatening the personal reputation of judges and the legitimacy of courts.",

Drawing on theories of intergroup collaboration and policymaking research, I argue that network polarization\u2014low frequencies of collaborative relations between lawmakers belonging to distinct political groups\u2014negatively affects crime legislation passage by reducing information flows, increasing intergroup hostility, and creating opportunities for political attacks. To evaluate this perspective, I recreate dynamic legislative networks between 1979 and 2005 using data on 1,897,019 cosponsorship relationships between 1537 federal lawmakers and the outcomes of 5950 federal crime bills. Results illustrate that increases in partisan network segregation and the number of densely clustered subgroups both have negative effects on bill passage. These relationships are not moderated by majority party status and peak during the 1990s and early 2000s, a period when prison growth showed its first signs of slowing. These findings provide new insight to the relationship between polarization and policy and suggest that increases in network polarization may be partly responsible for declines in crime policy adoption observed in recent decades.",

    "description": "AbstractWhile the progress of the knowledge economy is inexorable, this paper argues that partisan politics and labor market institutions can affect the direction in which the knowledge economy progresses. In particular, a combination of corporatist industrial relations systems and left partisanship tends to foster greater wage restraint, and such a wage outcome tends to encourage the greater adoption of communications technology than information-processing technology in the economy. This reorientation of the knowledge economy toward communications technology, in turn, has egalitarian distributive implications. In particular, the greater adoption of communications technology reduces wage inequality across the board in lower 90\u201310, 50\u201310, as well as 90\u201350 wage ratios. These arguments are tested using data across 15\u201321 OECD countries (1970\u20132015).",

Existing work suggests that people are rationalizing, misinformed, or misled. This article proposes an additional explanation: Inequality itself makes economic and racial disparities difficult to understand. In unequal societies, individuals establish their networks at formative institutions patterned by class and race. As a result, they unwittingly condition on key causal pathways when making descriptive and causal inferences about inequality. We use a simple agent-based model to show that, under circumstances typical to highly stratified societies, individuals will underestimate the extent of economic and racial inequality, downplay the importance of inherited advantages, and overestimate the relative importance of individual ability. Moreover, we show that they will both underestimate the extent of racial discrimination and overestimate its relative importance. Because segregated social worlds bias inference in these ways, all individuals (rich and poor) have principled reasons to favor less redistribution than they would if their social worlds were more integrated.",

    "description": "AbstractTo modernize public service delivery, U.S. communities increasingly rely on 311 systems for residents to request government services. Research on 311 systems is relatively new, and there is mixed evidence on whether 311 can help bridge the gap between disadvantaged communities and governments. This study draws from research on immigration, race/ethnicity, and differential engagement to explore the link between immigrant concentration and 311 usage. We use longitudinal data on 311 requests in Baltimore City, Maryland (2014\u20132019) and spatial panel regression analysis to show that neighborhood racial/ethnic structure and the national policy environment can significantly influence whether immigrant concentration is a barrier for 311 service-seeking. Specifically, we find that immigrant concentration reduces 311 requests in high-immigrant neighborhoods with Latino or Black concentration, but not in high-immigrant neighborhoods with White/Asian concentration. We also find that in Latino high-immigrant neighborhoods, the relationship between immigrant concentration and 311 requests appears mainly after 2017, when the federal government adopted hostile immigration policies. By establishing and contextualizing the relationship between immigrant concentration and 311 usage, the study contributes to a deeper understanding of civic participation and the connection between immigrant communities and government.",

    "description": "AbstractPast studies have established the existence of a persistent gender gap in re-partnering, wherein women are less likely to re-partner than men in the general population. Existing theories and explanations focus on women\u2019s and men\u2019s socio-demographic characteristics as mechanisms determining their opportunities, needs, and attractiveness in the re-partnering process. However, this work assumes that people are heterosexual and overlooks sexual minorities despite growing scholarly interest in union formation and dissolution among Lesbian, Gay, and Bisexual (LGB) people. We investigate whether and how the gender gap in re-partnering intersects with sexual identity to highlight the role of gender relations as a social force that shapes union formation outcomes among both the heterosexual and LGB population. We use retrospective data on cohabitation and marriage histories from the British Understanding Society survey (UKHLS) to estimate event history models. We confirm the existence of a gender gap favoring men among heterosexuals but find that lesbian women are more likely to re-partner than gay men. We do not observe a gender gap among bisexuals. Results are robust to accounting for compositional differences between groups using exact matching techniques. These findings suggest that the persistent gender gap found in past studies is not as universal as previously presumed and that sexual identity plays a vital role in re-partnering outcomes. Therefore, sociologists should explicitly incorporate the gender relational context into models and theories that explain gender differences in union formation outcomes.",

    "description": "AbstractGender and racial pay penalties are well-known: women (of all races) and people of color (of all genders) earn less, on average, even when they gain access to occupations historically reserved for White men. Studies of social mobility show that people from working-class backgrounds in the US have also been excluded from top professional and managerial occupations. But do working-class-origin people who attain top US jobs face a class-origin pay penalty? Despite evidence of class-origin pay gaps in higher professional and managerial occupations elsewhere, we might expect that the central role of race and racism in US stratification processes, along with the relatively low salience of class identities, would render class origins irrelevant to earnings in exclusive occupations, at least within racial groups. Using the Panel Study of Income Dynamics to link childhood class position to adult occupation and earnings, we describe the racial and class-origin composition of different high-status occupations and the earnings of people within them. We show that when people who are from working-class backgrounds are upwardly mobile into high-status occupations, they earn almost $20,000 per year less, on average, than individuals who are themselves from privileged backgrounds. The difference is partly explained by the upwardly mobile being less likely to have college degrees, but it remains substantial (around $11,700) even after accounting for education, race and other important predictors of earnings. The gap is largest among White people; there is a class-origin penalty in top US occupations that is distinct from the racial pay gap.",

Yet, most studies on the gendered division of labor focus almost exclusively on changes either in work or family domain. Doing so neglects the process through which couples negotiate and contest traditional work and family responsibilities. Studies that do examine these tradeoffs have highlighted how work\u2013family strategies range far beyond simple traditional-egalitarian dichotomies but are limited to specific points in time or population subgroups. Using data from the Panel Study of Income Dynamics and latent-class analysis, this article provides the first population-based estimates of the couple-level tradeoffs inherent in work\u2013family strategies in the United States, documents trends in the share of couples who fall into each of these strategies, and considers social stratification by gender and college education in these trends. Specifically, I identify seven distinct work\u2013family strategies (traditional, neotraditional, her-second-shift, egalitarian, his-second-shift, female-breadwinner, and neither-full-time couples). Egalitarian couples experienced the fastest increase in prevalence among college-educated couples, whereas couples that lacked two full-time earners increased among less-educated couples. Still, about a quarter of all couples adopted \u201cher-second-shift\u201d strategies, with no variation across time, making it the modal work\u2013family strategy among dual-earner couples. The long-run, couple-level results support the view that the gender revolution has stalled and suggest that this stall may be caused partly by strong traditional gender preferences, whereas structural resources appear to facilitate gender equality among a selected few.",

    "description": "AbstractAll around the world, school-entry cohorts are organized on an annual calendar so that the age of students in the same cohort differs by up to one year. It is a well-established finding that this age gap entails a consequential (dis)advantage for academic performance referred to as the relative age effect (RAE). This study contributes to a recent strand of research that has turned to investigate the RAE on non-academic outcomes such as personality traits. An experimental setup is used to estimate the causal effect of monthly age on cognitive effort in a sample of 798 fifth-grade students enrolled in the Spanish educational system, characterized by strict enrolment rules. Participants performed three different real-effort tasks under three different incentive conditions: no rewards; material rewards; and material and status rewards. We observe that older students outwork their youngest peers by two-fifths of a standard deviation, but only when material rewards for performance are in place. Despite the previously reported higher taste for competition among the older students within a school-entry cohort, we do not find that the RAE on cognitive effort increases after inducing competition for peer recognition. Finally, the study also provides suggestive evidence of a larger RAE among boys and students from lower social strata. Implications for sociological research on educational inequality are discussed. To conclude, we outline policy recommendations such as implementing evaluation tools that nudge teachers toward being mindful of relative age differences.",

The compelled mobility approach emphasizes the uneven distribution of organizational and institutional resources across urban space, expecting residents of poor Black-segregated neighborhoods to exhibit non-trivial levels of everyday exposure to White, non-poor areas for resource seeking. We use two sets of location data in the hypersegregated Chicago metro to examine these two approaches: Global Positioning System (GPS) location tracking on a sample of older adults from the Chicago Health and Activity Space in Real-Time (CHART) study and travel diaries on a sample of younger adults by the Chicago Metropolitan Agency for Planning (CMAP). We introduce a novel and flexible individual-level method for assessing activity space exposures that accounts for the spatially proximate environment around home. Analyses reveal that activity space contexts mimic the racial/ethnic and socio-economic landscape of respondents\u2019 broad residential environment. However, after residential-based adjustment, Black younger (CMAP) adults from poor Black neighborhoods are disproportionately exposed to Whiter, less Black but less non-poor neighborhoods. Older (CHART) adult activity spaces align more closely with their residential areas; however, activity spaces of poor-Black-neighborhood-residing CHART Blacks are systematically poorer and, less consistently, more Black and less White after local area adjustment. Implications for understanding contextual exposures on well-being and the potential for age or cohort differences in isolation are discussed.",

    "link": "https://share.osf.io/preprint/E00D4-986-64B",
    "description": "The concept of hegemonic masculinity maintains a distinctive status within the social sciences and humanities. Yet there never has been an examination of Connell\u2019s changing conceptualization of the term throughout her scholarship, and specifically when and why she integrated \u2018legitimation\u2019 into her definition of hegemonic masculinity. The authors address this oversight by providing a detailed retrospective on the concept from its embryonic conceptualizations to its eventual reformulation. Within this historical assessment, the authors further consider Connell\u2019s broader feminist theory of gender and how legitimation of the hegemonic masculinity/emphasized femininity relationship is central to that theory. The concepts of hegemonic masculinity and emphasized femininity and the theory in which they are embedded developed in tandem over time. The paper emphasizes that during this dual development, legitimation of unequal gender relations became the theoretical linchpin for conceptualizing hegemonic masculinity and eventually its relationship to emphasized femininity as a part of Connell\u2019s larger gender theory. The paper also demonstrates that over time Connell progressively changed the meaning of hegemonic masculinity in significant ways and concludes with a discussion of recent \u2018legitimation processes\u2019 that have appeared in the literature, and how each contributes unique ways of conceptualizing the legitimation of unequal gender relations.",

    "description": "La presente disertaci\u00f3n doctoral ofrece un abordaje de la est\u00e9tica del techno. Su prop\u00f3sito principal es articular un an\u00e1lisis musicol\u00f3gico de sus caracter\u00edsticas t\u00e9cnicas y formales, una revisi\u00f3n de las categor\u00edas est\u00e9ticas que se han utilizado para comprender su experiencia y una interpretaci\u00f3n cr\u00edtica a partir del concepto de fetichismo aplicado a la m\u00fasica. Este trabajo parte de la idea de que el concepto techno no es algo un\u00edvocamente dado. Proponemos la construcci\u00f3n del mismo a partir del desarrollo de una constelaci\u00f3n de n\u00facleos tem\u00e1ticos en tensi\u00f3n. El proceder del texto, la articulaci\u00f3n entre los cap\u00edtulos y los problemas abordados, responde a la necesidad de desplegar dichas tensiones e indagar sus fundamentos. El an\u00e1lisis parte de las consecuencias formales y l\u00f3gicas temporales que implican t\u00e9cnicas como el loop y el looping, e incorpora progresivamente narrativas de ravers y categor\u00edas an\u00e1liticas de trabajos acad\u00e9micos abocados al estudio de este objeto en tanto experiencias que desbordan el \u00e1mbito meramente musicol\u00f3gico. Nuestra cr\u00edtica hilvana estas dimensiones dispares advirtiendo l\u00f3gicas en contradicci\u00f3n como son las de: linealidad y no linealidad, estatismo y movimiento; cercan\u00eda y distanciamiento; determinaci\u00f3n y abstracci\u00f3n; dominio y libertad; excitaci\u00f3n y contemplaci\u00f3n; superficialidad y profundidad; identificaci\u00f3n y encarnaci\u00f3n; trance y \u00e9xtasis; revelaci\u00f3n y fetichismo. Todas estas l\u00f3gicas contradictorias se constituyen como n\u00facleos de la constelaci\u00f3n de dilemas al interior de lo que llamamos techno. Que la cr\u00edtica al techno se presente como despliegue de las tensiones inmanentes implica tambi\u00e9n que el mismo no permanece id\u00e9ntico a s\u00ed en cada uno de los cap\u00edtulos. En este sentido, el techno ser\u00e1 pensado como g\u00e9nero musical, pero tambi\u00e9n como conjunto de t\u00e9cnicas compositivas, como forma, como temporalidad, como un tipo de escucha, como reacciones y vivencias de ravers, como forma del aparecer y, finalmente, como mercanc\u00eda fetichizada. Desafiando las interpretaciones que conciben el \u00e9xtasis del techno como una vivencia m\u00edstica \u201capol\u00edtica\u201d, no ideol\u00f3gica, de \u201cpercepci\u00f3n pura\u201d, inmediata, y de completa disoluci\u00f3n del sujeto, este trabajo propone una cr\u00edtica que expone una dimensi\u00f3n social e hist\u00f3rica en las fibras \u00edntimas de estas experiencias. Es justamente el concepto de fetichismo el que nos permite reconocer esta dimensi\u00f3n social e ideol\u00f3gica en el techno. A su vez, esta clave de lectura nos permite corroborar la vigencia de la perspectiva cr\u00edtica que representa el trabajo de Theodor. W. Adorno sobre el fetichismo y la regresi\u00f3n de la escucha. La singularidad de nuestro trabajo no consiste solamente en abordar al techno retomando aportes de la escuela de Frankfurt, sino en evitar su inmediata reducci\u00f3n a los consabidos postulados en torno al concepto de \u201cindustria cultural\u201d. Recurrir al concepto de fetichismo, por sobre el de industria cultural, permite dar lugar a una forma de cr\u00edtica que comprende el car\u00e1cter real de las intensas vivencias de cualidades m\u00edsticas, la fuerza de la apariencia y la ilusi\u00f3n de un lenguaje natural, sin mera reacci\u00f3n contingente o caprichosa de un sujeto particular. A partir del an\u00e1lisis del fetichismo, esas vivencias adquieren un car\u00e1cter objetivo como coagulaci\u00f3n social en el interior mismo de la m\u00fasica. Adem\u00e1s, este concepto nos permite contener no s\u00f3lo una dimensi\u00f3n subjetiva de las reacciones de ravers ante la m\u00fasica, sino la articulaci\u00f3n de estas con el an\u00e1lisis t\u00e9cnico y formal del techno sin caer en meras linealidades del tipo est\u00edmulo-respuesta.",

    "description": "The social acceptance of medical technology is crucial for the sustainability and effectiveness of healthcare systems, particularly in the context of demographic changes. Unlike most studies that focus on individual technologies, we measure the public perception across a range of medical technologies in a comprehensive study. We conducted an online survey with 193 participants from Germany and Bulgaria to assess perceived risk, utility, and overall attitudes (valence) toward 20 distinct medical technologies. This article presents a visual mapping of these technologies and investigates the individual and technology-related factors shaping these evaluations. Our findings suggest that perceived utility is the strongest predictor of overall attitude toward medical technology (\u03b2=0.886), with perceived risk playing a significant, albeit much smaller, role (\u03b2=-0.133). Together, these factors explain a substantial portion of the variance in overall attitudes (R^2=.959). Additionally, we found that individual differences, such as prior care experience and trust in physicians, significantly influence these perceptions. The article concludes with recommendations for effectively communicating the benefits and risks of medical technologies to the public, thereby enhancing their social acceptance and integration into healthcare systems.",

    "description": "Women are underrepresented in positions of power and leadership in higher education and the challenges faced by women in order to reach these senior positions in academia are complex and have received considerable attention in recent years. In this work, we quantify gender diversity in Brazilian academia using three types of indicators: production of knowledge, temporal evolution in the career, and training of human resources to study in detail the profile of the Deans of Research and Graduate Studies in 215 Higher Education Institutions in the year of 2019. Our analysis shows that around only 36% of positions were occupied by women, a percentage that is not consistent with the number of women professors in Brazilian higher education. Using the National Council for Scientific and Technological Development Lattes\u2019 Platform databank, we show that men and women in dean positions publish roughly the same number of paper/scientific articles per year and present almost the same time elapsed in the career path, while women produce more human resources. The fact that women occupy only 1/3 of the positions of dean of research and graduation reveals that for women to reach the top, it is necessary that they adapt to the same metric intended for men while facing additional challenges indicating a persistent glass ceiling.",

    "description": "Our work proposes to highlight the role of territorial determinants and more particularly those of socio-economic nature in the development of a territorial soy industry in the Hauts-de-France region, France. The approach consists of highlighting how and what are the conditions and the forms of the determinants of social capital to anchor a sustainable local soy industry. Thus, in our paper, these socio-economic determinants take the form of the collective dynamics of farmers which constitute a major factor in the establishment of soy culture in different territories of Hauts-de-France region. In this paper we have chosen a qualitative approach using a grid of semi-directive interviews with agricultural stakeholders, as part of the DOP Picardie project . The various players involved in the soya commodity chain were interviewed, with a comparative analysis of two study areas, Bourgogne Franche Comt\u00e9 and Marne. Our surveys and their interpretations yielded numerous results in the form of motivations, constraints, and recommendations for the sustainable establishment of soya sector in Hauts-de-France, as well as the identifying the socio-economic, agronomic, and regulatory factors that come together as collective actions to promote this sector.",

Compared to a benevolent policymaker benchmark, I show that reputational concerns can lead to suboptimal policymaking, as a result of the interdependence between voters' learning about implemented policies and their induced preferences over politicians: when favourable policy outcomes lead voters to prefer policy persistence, the desire to appear responsive can stifle the implementation of the right environmental policy.",

    "description": "Nature connection is an important leverage point for both human wellbeing and planetary health. While previous research has identified associations between nature connection and wellbeing, there has been little examination of how different wellbeing measures are associated with nature connection, and how this correlation varies by population groups. We seek to fill this gap through a survey of 4006 individuals in Australia. We find a strong association between nature connection and two measures of wellbeing: life satisfaction, and health-related quality-of-life. The association between nature connection and life satisfaction was similar to that of income and life satisfaction. The association between nature connection and wellbeing was found to be particularly strong for younger people, and those who speak a language other than English at home. Through developing a measure examining one\u2019s life satisfaction relative to their health-related quality-of-life, we find that those with higher levels of nature connection tend to have greater life satisfaction than health-related quality-of-life. These findings highlight the important role policy can play in enhancing nature connection to improve wellbeing, such as expanding green space development and providing individuals with more opportunities to meaningfully connect with nature.

    "description": "A sequence of technological inventions over several centuries has dramatically lowered the cost of producing and distributing information. Because culture and societies ride on a substrate of information, these changes have profoundly impacted how we live, work, and interact with each other. This paper explores the nature of information architectures (IAs)\u2014the features that govern how information flows within human populations. IAs include physical and digital infrastructures, norms and institutions, and algorithmic technologies for filtering, producing, and disseminating information. IAs shape everyday lives and cultural practices; they can reinforce societal biases and discriminations and lead to prosocial outcomes as well as unintended social ills. IAs have culturally evolved rapidly with human usage, creating new affordances and new problems for the dynamics of social interaction. We explore the significant societal outcomes instigated by shifts in IAs and call for an enhanced understanding of the social implications of increasing IA complexity, the nature of competition among IAs, and the creation of mechanisms for coordination to guide the beneficial use of IAs. Navigating the challenges IAs pose requires creative experimentation, novel tools, and an understanding of societal norms and institutions. Given that the speed and influence of IAs are accelerating, research in this area is increasingly imperative to ensure that the nature of IAs aligns with a collectively desirable future.",

This research investigates what is needed to lift the quality of Australian housing to align with international standards so as to address problems associated with aged and ill-performing housing stock in both the owned and rented sectors. The research explores different strategies for improving housing through voluntary programs and mandatory legislation, and found: a national strategy to improve residential building quality should be developed mandatory disclosure of dwelling energy performance could improve how markets consider the performance of houses offered for sale or lease more appropriate accounting methods of the benefits provided by improved housing standards are needed. To improve the building quality of Australian housing stock, it is important to investigate how and why governments make policy about the quality of Australian housing stock. Change is difficult because of both the challenges of getting government attention and pressure from strong property industry lobbyists, but it is not impossible. One of the sharp lessons from the case studies is that having research evidence is not enough; change needs key elements such as building a convincing narrative to tell a plausible story of a social problem (including coverage of the evidence in the popular media) together with a \u2018coalition of support\u2019. A national strategy to improve residential building quality should be developed and include the following regulatory mechanisms: improved performance standards for new houses; mandatory disclosure of dwelling energy performance; and minimum housing standards for the rental sector.",

    "description": "How do we imagine economic objects, processes, and actions? More importantly, if the future is inherently uncertain what limits the range of possible imaginings such that actors can agree and coordinate? Building on the work of Jens Beckert, I outline an approach to imagination and imaginative labor in economic sociology grounded on the insight that embodied cognition is central to the capacity for exploring possibilities for action and organizing abstract domains. To demonstrate this approach, I use examples from a field whose fictional expectations have a significant impact on the global political-economy: elite professional advisory firms. This is a field in the business of selling imaginative labor, both within the backstage work of recruiting and the frontstage work of selling.",

    "link": "https://share.osf.io/preprint/E0112-46F-E74",
    "description": "Background: The escalating hostilities with Israel that began on 7 October 2023 have intensified the already dire situation in Gaza, with power outages and severe shortages of medicines and health supplies crippling hospitals' ability to deliver life-saving care. Using Gaza as a case study, in this article we introduce the concept of \u201cjustice-orientated statistical counter-stories\u201d. Methods: We argue that traditional statistics distort reality, hide disparities, and generally misrepresent social and environmental issues. We show that by making \u201cadjustments\u201d based on identifiable flaws in raw statistical datasets we can rectify this problem and offer an alternative view. We illustrate the principles of justice-oriented statistical counter-stories by examining the aid flow to Gaza in 2023 from major OECD countries. Results: Our justice-orientated analytical lens shows how the rankings for OECD countries shift significantly when we factor in donor nations\u2019 GDP and military aid donations to Israel, who are propagating a war against the Palestinian people. Our paper also identifies some of the key methodological challenges in making such adjustments (issues of aggregated data, asymmetrical data periods and unavailable data). Conclusion: We conclude by emphasising the broader implications of \u201cjustice-orientated statistical counter-stories\u201d for understanding not only aid flows, but global development and the representation of social and environmental issues.",

    "description": "This study analyses data from the Annual Children in Need Census (2015-2023) obtained via Freedom of Information requests to examine whether there has been a shift towards a more investigative approach in handling cases involving children with disabilities or mental health concerns in England. The results show a 77.1% increase in assessments identifying these concerns, now comprising a quarter of all assessments. For children with disabilities or mental health concerns, Section 47 investigations surged by 145.2%, compared to a 45.4% rise for children without these factors. Simultaneously, the proportion of children whose primary need was classified as \"disability or illness\" dropped by 17.4%, indicating a declining focus on addressing their specific needs. The study echoes concerns from parent-led groups and prior research, suggesting that social care services are increasingly treating families of disabled children as potential risks rather than focusing on their needs, fostering \"parent carer blame.\" This trend, rooted in a risk-averse social work culture, highlights the need to reconsider current assessment practices, which may be intrusive and harmful to families seeking support. The findings call for a re-evaluation of social care policies to better address the needs of disabled children without defaulting to investigative procedures.",

    "description": "Early assessment of reading abilities is important for ensuring long-term academic and career-related success. Pre-reading assessment tools can identify children at risk of future reading difficulties. However, most bilingual children do not have access to appropriate early reading assessments. This is due to the lack of language-appropriate assessment tools. The current longitudinal study examines the predictive validity of a linguistically- and culturally-responsive Urdu Phonological Tele-Assessment (U-PASS) tool, including subtests for phonological awareness and rapid automatized naming (RAN) \u2014 commonly-assessed reading precursors. Specifically, we investigate whether kindergarten-level Urdu phonological awareness and RAN skills predict the future Grade 1 Urdu reading accuracy and fluency skills of Urdu-English bilinguals in two bilingual contexts: Pakistan (where Urdu is spoken as a national language; n = 104; Experiment 1) and Canada (where Urdu is spoken as a heritage language; n = 50; Experiment 2). Hierarchical linear regression analyses demonstrate predictive validity of the U-PASS tool across the two country contexts. Particularly, Urdu phonological awareness emerged as a consistent longitudinal predictor of Urdu word/non-word reading accuracy and fluency, while RAN was a reliable predictor of the reading fluency measures. The U-PASS tool provides access to linguistically- and culturally-responsive early pre-reading assessment, and enables researchers, speech-language pathologists, and educators to examine pre-reading skills in the heritage-language of Urdu-speaking children globally.",

    "description": "Background: When COVID-19 vaccines became available, healthcare workers (HCWs) were prioritized for vaccination. Despite debate, vaccine mandates were implemented in most healthcare settings across Canada, including Ontario, with many still in effect. Goal: This study examines Ontario HCWs' perspectives on vaccine mandates, focusing on their decision-making experiences, the mandates' impact on their lives and livelihoods, and their views on the effects of mandates on patient care. Methods: An online cross-sectional survey was conducted among Ontario HCWs of diverse vaccination status, professions, ages, socioeconomic status, races/ethnicities, and genders. Recruitment was through professional networks and snowball sampling. We performed a thematic analysis of responses to one open-ended question and to open-ended options in closed questions. Quantitative results are reported separately. Results: Out of 468 participants, 225 responded to the open-ended question, and 111 provided answers to open-ended options in closed questions. Most respondents were unvaccinated, had been terminated for non-compliance with vaccination mandates, experienced personal losses, and reported negative views on mandates and their impacts on patient care. Six themes emerged: 1) policies conflicting with scientific evidence and professional practice; 2) conflicts with medical ethics; 3) unaccounted for or dismissed personal hardships; 4) unacknowledged for or dismissed physical harms; 5) discrimination against unvaccinated individuals; and 6) negative impacts on patient care. Conclusions: The study indicates significant harm to HCWs and patients due to mandates, and advocates for the cessation of mandated vaccination in favor of evidence-based, ethical policies.",

    "description": "The idea that labor scarcity can induce economic development has been long hypothesized (Hicks, 1932; Habakkuk, 1962), but the evidence is scarce, especially on non-agricultural development. In this paper, I assess the role of the Second Great Migration (1940-1970) on the subsequent structural change in the American South between 1970 and 2010. Empirical results using shift-share instruments show that out-migration incentivized physical capital investment and capital-augmenting technical change, increasing capital and output per worker in both agriculture and manufacturing at least until 2010. Labor reallocated from agriculture to nonagriculture. I then develop and calibrate a dynamic spatial equilibrium model that allows substitution between factors of production, factor-biased technical change, and Heckscher\u2013Ohlin forces in trade. The quantitative results indicate that the adjustments to the Second Great Migration could have contributed to 7% of the total decrease in agricultural employment between 1940 and 2010 in the South. The contribution analyses suggest that labor-capital substitution played a leading role in economic adjustment to the migration, with capital-biased technical change and the quasi-Rybczynski effect playing important supplementary roles.",

    "description": "Our understanding of typical smartphone behavior has only recently begun to advance due to the accessibility of increasingly valid data sources. Beyond analysing the frequency, duration, and content of smartphone activities, there is substantial value in understanding when people engage in particular forms of mobile media use, and data collection methods that go beyond simple retrospective self-reports provide the means to do so. This paper contributes to our understanding of contemporary smartphone usage patterns and their temporal dynamics by employing a mixed-method dataset obtained through Android logging, iOS data donation, and mobile experience sampling methods. This dataset captures both the quantity and quality of smartphone use among a large, quota-targeted sample of German adults (n = 2032). The findings provide a comprehensive view of smartphone use, examining both overall trends and daily rhythms. They reveal that smartphone usage is typified by frequent, short interactions, with younger users displaying more fragmented patterns compared to older counterparts, alongside variations in the gratifications derived across age groups. These findings lay the groundwork for further theorization about the causes, nature, and consequences of the observed usage patterns, while also offering essential contextual and methodological insights for researchers employing intensive longitudinal approaches to evaluate smartphone usage.",

    "description": "Where do queer immigrants settle in the United States? The policy landscape for same-sex couples in the U.S. has changed rapidly in recent years, with immigrants being particularly affected. After the 2013 end of the Defense of Marriage Act, U.S. citizens could finally sponsor the visa of a same-sex partner, and number of immigrants in same-sex couples increased rapidly. But little is known about where these lesbian, gay, and bisexual (LGB) immigrants choose to settle and enjoy their new rights. Do they behave more similarly to their straight immigrant counterparts and locate based on job opportunities and cost of living? Or do they gravitate toward more queer-friendly cities and states, as U.S.-born LGB people do? How have these patterns changed over time, especially in response to local policy changes relevant to queer people and immigrants? Using American Community Survey data from 2008-2022 and original datasets, this paper implements descriptive analyses and quasi-Poisson models to study how settlement patterns of immigrants in same-sex couples in the U.S. respond to local and national policy changes as well as other local sociodemographic and economic factors. We find that the distribution of immigrants in same-sex couples is expanding across the U.S. over time. These settlement patterns generally look more similar to fellow U.S.-born LGB Americans: locations with higher concentrations are more progressive, have more robust LGBTQ+ civic life, and have higher incomes. Yet immigrants in same-sex couples also live in more racially and ethnically diverse areas compared to U.S.-born Americans in same-sex couples. Our findings contribute to a fuller understanding of this rapidly growing population and under which conditions they may behave more similarly to their fellow migrants, their fellow sexual minorities, or as a distinct population all their own.",

    "link": "https://share.osf.io/preprint/E00B1-443-C92",
    "description": "Differences-in-differences designs for estimating causal effects rely on an assumption of ``parallel trends\" -- that in the absence of the intervention, treated units would have followed the same outcome trajectory as observed in control units. When parallel trends fails, researchers often turn to alternative strategies that relax this identifying assumption. One popular approach is the inclusion of a group-specific linear time trend in the commonly used two-way fixed effects (TWFE) estimator. In a setting with a single post-treatment and two pre-treatment periods it is well known that this is equivalent to a non-parametric ``triple-differences\" estimator which is valid under a ``parallel trends-in-trends\" assumption (Egami and Yamauchi, 2023). This paper analyzes the TWFE estimator with group-specific linear time trends in the more general setting with many pre- and post-treatment periods. It shows that this estimator can be interpreted as an average over triple-differences terms involving both pre-treatment and post-treatment observations. As a consequence, this estimator does not identify a convex average of post-treatment ATTs without additional effect homogeneity assumptions even when there is no staggering in treatment adoption. A straightforward solution is to make the TWFE specification fully dynamic with a separate parameter for each relative treatment time. However, identification requires that researchers omit at least two pre-treatment relative treatment time indicators to estimate a group-specific linear trend. The paper shows how to properly extend this estimator to the staggered adoption setting using the approach of Sun and Abraham (2021), correcting a perfect collinearity error in recent implementations of this method in Hassell and Holbein (2024). It concludes with a note of caution for researchers, showing through a replication of Kogan (2021) how inferences from group-specific time trend specifications can be extremely sensitive to arbitrary specification choices when parallel trends violations are present but do not follow an easily observed functional form.",

Through an empirically informed agent-based model, this study provides support for the proposed theoretical pathway and shows that, when combined with empirically representative structural inequalities, this racial composition effect can help explaining the pattern of interest.

Informed by this literature, this article unpacks the necessary and sufficient conditions under which the hoarding of educational resources emerges within schools. It develops a qualitatively informed agent-based model which captures Black and White students' competition for a valuable school resource: advanced coursework. In contrast to traditional accounts --- which explain the emergence of hoarding through the actions of Whites that keep valuable resources within White communities --\u2013 simulations, perhaps surprisingly, show hoarding to arise even when Whites do not play the role of hoarders of resources. Behind this result is the fact that a structural inequality (i.e., racial differences in social class), and not action-driven hoarding, is the necessary condition for hoarding to emerge. Findings, therefore, illustrate that common action-driven understandings of opportunity hoarding can overlook the structural foundations behind this important phenomenon.

    "description": "Sociological research on careers and organizations suggests that those with a wide range of skills (generalists) are disadvantaged due to the dispersion of their competencies, whereas those with a focused expertise in a specific area (specialists) benefit from a deeper understanding of their domain. This study tests the applicability of these findings to academia, assessing whether scholars with a specialized publication output are more likely to obtain tenure than those with a more generalist output. Using a combination of computational quantitative text analysis of 5497 journal abstracts published along with longitudinal career data covering CV and publication data of sociology professors in German academia, first, we find that a generalist research focus has a positive and statistically significant effect on attaining tenure. In addition, male sociologists derive greater benefits from a generalist publication strategy, whereas female sociologists experience greater advantages from specialization. Second, we disentangle the overall effect into \u2018qualitative\u2019 and \u2018quantitative\u2019 specialization. Our results show a slight but non-significant advantage for sociologists who focus primarily on publishing quantitative research.

    "description": "With both affective polarization and populism on the rise in several countries, many have proposed a link between the two phenomena. Yet, research offers little direct evidence on whether populist individuals are more polarized. This paper aims to fill this gap by using CSES data from 37 elections in 31 countries to provide a comparative account of the relationship between populism and affective polarization at the individual level. We show that populist individuals are not more polarized than their mainstream counterparts. Instead, we identify a curvilinear relationship wherein both citizens who strongly endorse or reject populist ideas exhibit high levels of polarization, with substantial variations across countries. Furthermore, populism is associated with a general disdain for all political parties rather than just rival parties. These findings challenge the prevailing assumption that populism is asymmetrically associated with affective polarization and suggest that ideological extremism, rather than populism, may be associated with the upsurge in affective polarization observed in some Western democracies.",

    "description": "Previous studies in the Nordic context report a positive association between a stronger labor market attachment and entry into parenthood (i.e., first birth), but the association is stronger for men than for women, and it is modified by educational attainment and life-course stage. This study asks whether and how the relationship between employment status and entry into parenthood has changed for women and men born in Finland in the 1970s, 1980s, and early 1990s. We first examine how the life-course situations in which women and men make decisions on entering parenthood have changed across cohorts. We use total population register data and event history methods and compare cohorts that differ, for example, in terms of the macroeconomic conditions they encountered during their young adulthood. Our results show that employment uncertainty, measured as unemployment, has not increased across cohorts. Women and men who are (still) childless are increasingly combining studies and paid employment. The positive association between a stronger labor market attachment and entry into parenthood has remained unchanged, while a cohort trend towards delayed or foregone entry into parenthood occurs regardless of labor market status. To tackle Finland\u2019s exceptionally low fertility rates at the policy level, we emphasize the need to design policies that better target women and men in different life situations.",

    "description": "Large language models have become popular over a short period of time because they can generate text that resembles human writing across various domains and tasks. The popularity and breadth of use also put this technology in the position to fundamentally reshape how written language is perceived and evaluated. It is also the case that spoken language has long played a role in maintaining power and hegemony in society, especially through ideas of social identity and ``correct'' forms of language. But as human communication becomes even more reliant on text and writing, it is important to understand how these processes might shift and who is more likely to see their writing styles reflected back at them through modern AI. We therefore ask the following question: \\textit{who} does generative AI write like? To answer this, we compare writing style features in over 150,000 college admissions essays submitted to a large public university system and an engineering program at an elite private university with a corpus of over 25,000 essays generated with GPT-3.5 and GPT-4 to the same writing prompts. We find that human-authored essays exhibit more variability across various individual writing style features (e.g., verb usage) than AI-generated essays. Overall, we find that the AI-generated essays are most similar to essays authored by students who are males with higher levels of social privilege. These findings demonstrate critical misalignments between human and AI authorship characteristics, which may affect the evaluation of writing and calls for research on control strategies to improve alignment.",

This paper considers the technology transition to the automobile in the early 20th C and the discursive and cultural power that states are typically considered to wield through their information collection and management activities. It compares the situation in places where the state was heavily involved in coordinating the technology transition through its information practices, and the situation in the US, where the state was an extreme outlier for its lack of involvement in the same processes. Results suggest that the state ought not to be seen as wielding power in this case, despite the clear importance of the state to the historical narrative in other countries, as the same outcomes were accomplished in the American case even without state involvement. This suggests that research may collectively overstate the in4luence that conventionally powerful actors wield through discourse and culture, and further suggests that states play a more subdued role during technology transitions than what is currently assumed in the literature.",

This paper explores the potential of international norm-making for scaling up the governance of digital technologies and infrastructures, which have trans- and supra-national effects but are currently only governed within national jurisdictions. We chart the international neoliberal consensus currently being formalised, which affirms that data is primarly an economic commodity and must be treated according to free-market principles. We argue that this is inadequate because it cannot address interests beyond the commercial, namely data\u2019s connections to bodies, land, community and labour. We then explore the history of norm-making and offer two assertions: first, that a norm-making lens can frame challenges to the primacy of market logics in law and governance, and second, that the conceptual exclusion of civil society actors as norm-makers is an obstacle to the recognition of counter-power in data governance.

    "link": "https://share.osf.io/preprint/E0030-814-797",
    "description": "Misinformation has become a critical challenge for organizations and societies, threatening to disrupt key social, economic and public health goals. With the pervasiveness of social media, and the advent of novel AI technologies, the scale and complexity of misinformation has reached unprecedented levels. Consequently, an important focus of social science research in this area has been to understand why individuals are susceptible to consuming and sharing misinformation online, and what can be done to mitigate its adverse effects. In this study, we re-examine and synthesize key findings on the psychological, social and technological drivers of misinformation from the past decade to emphasize important gaps and avenues for future research on the topic. Based on our integrative review, we highlight four important directions for researchers and policy makers to consider. First, it will be useful to expand the definition of misinformation beyond notions of information quality and facticity, and incorporate its potential for manipulation and harm. Second, there is an urgent need to invest in more causal studies that can establish (or falsify) the harmful impacts of online misinformation in critical domains such as politics, health and marketing. Third, we need to better understand non-cognitive and motivational pathways of misinformation spread i.e., how/why misinformation proliferates as a result of social processes, both at an interpersonal (e.g., due to self-presentational motives) and societal level (e.g., due to declining trust in mainstream institutions, and increasing social polarization). Lastly, future studies should reinvestigate current findings in the context of emerging digital populations and platforms that currently remain understudied. Drawing on these findings, we highlight key areas for improving policies and technologies to mitigate the potential harms of misinformation.",

Seventy-two respondents whose attitudes toward authenticity were classified as realists, constructivists, and postmodernists watched a video about the Hobbiton Movie Set, a staged attraction in Rotorua, New Zealand. Heartbeat data was converted into three measures of heart rate variability: time-domain, frequency-domain, and qualitative non-linear measure. Heart rate variability differed among authenticity groups. People with realist attitudes stayed more focused and had lower HRV. Postmodernists were the most likely to accept the staged attraction as authentic and their kind of place to visit. Promotional materials generating positive arousal contributed to positive authentication.",

    "description": "This article addresses the controversial topic of public resistance to immigration, focusing on the role that occupations play and how they can shape cultural responses against immigrants. In particular, the study focuses on occupation-specific skills (OSS), which are assets whose returns depend on the occupational labor market context. When occupational unemployment is low relative to job vacancies, OSS protect against labor market competition, but their effectiveness decreases when unemployment increases. As a result, occupations with high OSS, such as professionals and managers, are particularly affected when the occupational labor market deteriorates. The paper claims that this deterioration in labor market prospects leads to a decline in the perception of social status, which in turn results in a cultural reaction against immigration. The paper fills the gap in the literature about why high-skilled workers may react culturally against outgroups. The results of several attitudinal surveys, including longitudinal data, support this argument.",

    "description": "Today, fast fashion is experiencing rapid growth, increasingly overshadowing ethical shopping practices. Even consumers with strong sustainability awareness find it increasingly challenging to align their ethical principles with their shopping behavior due to the overwhelming availability of fast fashion products. This study aims to deepen the understanding of consumer exposure to fast fashion by synthesizing existing analytical methods with data on the sustainability practices of fast fashion companies. We conducted an online survey with items assigned to predefined factors, calculated the sustainability performance of selected fast fashion companies, and integrated this information into the survey results. We then grouped items per factor using cluster analysis and investigated the strengths and directions of the relationships between factors and the identified clusters through descriptive analysis. The results indicate that respondents' shopping patterns, along with their opinions on the sustainability of selected fast fashion companies, have a discernible effect on their shopping behavior. A gap between consumers' attitudes and behavior was observed; however, the results also show positive tendencies, with consumers who have strong sustainability attitudes making up the largest share among those with strong sustainable shopping behavior. Notably, female respondents displayed a much more pronounced sustainable attitude. Generation Y exhibited a stronger environmental attitude toward shopping, as well as more pronounced sustainable shopping behavior, compared to Generation Z. No significant difference in shopping behavior between consumers from urban and non-urban areas was detected. This study links relevant attitudinal and behavioral information to the sustainability practices of fast fashion companies through sampling and unsupervised analysis methods, marking a further step toward understanding consumers' exposure to fast fashion consumption and the potential barriers influencing the discrepancy between purchasing attitudes and behavior.",

The results of our study show how these perceptions of legitimacy of the EU and national executives that are expressed in the letters to the editor were debated differently in the two crises studied. Additionally, we find that there was a clear focus on the national executive during the pandemic. Furthermore, the crises provide a public opportunity to criticise how the political system works, thus contesting the legitimacy of EU or national polity extending beyond concrete policy measures.",

    "description": "The inherent \"take-make-waste\" of the current linear economy is a major contributor to exceeding planetary boundaries. The transition to a circular economy (CE) and the associated challenges and opportunities requires fast, innovative solutions. Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML) are poised to play a pivotal role in facilitating this transition by addressing the challenges of increasing material extraction and use, ultimately contributing to a more environmentally sustainable future. This article aims to provide an overview of the current state of AI and ML in the transition to CE and to discuss their potential and associated challenges. A literature survey conducted on Google Scholar, using targeted queries with predefined keywords and search operators, revealed that the number of experimental scientific contributions related to AI and ML in CE has grown significantly in recent years. As the volume of research articles has increased, so has the diversity of ML methods and algorithms featured in experimental CE publications. Furthermore, we found that since 2020, there has been an 84% increase in AI and ML-related research articles on CE in Google Scholar, compared to the total number of such entries, and a 55% increase in articles since 2023, compared to those published up to 2023. The current state of scientific contributions indicates that AI and ML are increasingly recognized as valuable tools for advancing the CE, and their application continues to grow steadily.",

Previous research faced empirical challenges with causal inference, limited sample sizes, and limited outcomes. I marshal data from 14 panel surveys from 1956 to 2022 with 48,629 respondents to help better understand the causal effects of union membership. In these data, I use difference-in-difference designs to evaluate whether gaining union membership causes voters to liberalize their attitudes and participate in politics. I do not find any evidence that union membership affects political behavior, and I show that we can reject modest effects in most cases. I also show that a prominent previous result is not robust. These results suggest a reconsideration of how labor unions influence politics.",

However, these barriers remain underexplored, particularly in fossil-fuel-rich countries such as Iran. This study examined women's opinions on barriers to implementing renewable energy in daily activities through semi-structured interviews. The interviewees were women residing in Tehran, and the number of interviews was determined based on the \"purposive sampling\" and \"theoretical sampling\" methods. Collecting data continued until no new features and concepts emerged. Employing grounded theory, we developed a model categorizing women\u2019s views into causal conditions (e.g., energy definitions, consumption behavior, renewable energy applications, global warming), context conditions (e.g., energy value, policy, accessibility, infrastructure), and intervening conditions (e.g., indigenous knowledge, motivation).

However, various barriers limit their participation, highlighting the need for targeted public policies. The study also identified gaps in achieving SDGs 5 (Gender Equality), 7 (Affordable & Clean Energy), 11 (Sustainable Cities & Communities), 12 (Responsible Consumption & Production), and 13 (Climate Action).

    "description": "Despite longstanding scholarly interest in migrant academic achievement, there has been little work to isolate an effect of migrating on student outcomes. This paper harnesses a causal inference framework to evaluate the effect of migration on young people's learning outcomes on a global scale. Using test score data from the 2012, 2015, and 2018 Programme for Student Assessment, it compares 8,726 migrants in 42 destination countries to 603,280 counterparts in 55 countries of origin. After adjustment for individual characteristics using Generalized Random Forests and Augmented Inverse Probability Weighting, multilevel techniques developed for meta-analysis aggregate effect estimates for each country pair and test the effects of country-level mediators. Generally, migrant students obtain slightly lower scores on these exams than similar stay-at-homes in their countries of origin, but results vary greatly by countries. Children who migrate to wealthier and more democratic countries tend to outperform stay-at-homes, and there is partial evidence that between-school tracking is associated with lower scores relative to stay-at-homes. In addition, children who migrate at older ages and who have two rather than one migrant parent tend to score lower.",

    "description": "Research on parasocial phenomena is thriving, and parasocial processing emerged as a key concept in the wake of this trend. The PSI-Process Scales (Schramm & Hartmann, 2008) initially provided a comprehensive tool for assessing parasocial processing, quickly becoming a widely used measure in the field. However, the scale\u2019s extensive length has posed challenges for consistent and full application, often resulting in ad-hoc modifications. To address these limitations, this study derives and systematically tests a shortened version of the PSI-Process Scales, termed the Parasocial Processing Short Scale (PP-SS). The theoretically grounded scale consists of only 9 items \u2013 3 per cognitive, affective, and behavioral parasocial processing. The scale is systematically developed and validated in two preregistered empirical studies, including a one-factorial experiment (n = 258) and a larger survey study (n = 720) that feature a range of different personae and diverse samples. Both studies confirm the PP-SS\u2019 good psychometric quality and validity within the concept\u2019s nomological network, as well as the scale\u2019s invariance across different user groups and personae.

    "description": "Procedural justice theory states that when police treat people in a fair, respectful, and neutral manner, individuals are more likely to perceive the police as legitimate and obey the law. To test this perspective, researchers often use experimental vignettes that depict police-citizen interactions and measure subsequent attitudes. However, it is not straightforward to determine causal effects from these designs, as one must carefully assess whether the effect runs through the intended theoretical pathways in order to properly test the theory. This paper advances beyond \u2018traditional\u2019 experimental designs to evaluate the pathways linking police-citizen interactions, attitudes, and behavioral intentions. The data consist of a representative sample of 2,003 adults residing in the United States using an online panel. We use a mixed methods approach combining a pre-registered 3x2x2 experimental vignette depicting a traffic stop by police with follow-up closed- and open-ended questions, allowing respondents to explain their reasoning. We found that the quality of treatment by police was statistically related to subsequent perceptions of police legitimacy, but not compliance. However, follow-up placebo tests and open-text responses revealed a number of confounding factors limiting the strength of causal claims regarding procedural justice theory. Most notably, a number of respondents expressed that they would comply with the officer in the moment, even if they disagree, out of fear of escalation and their own personal safety. Research using (quasi-)experimental designs should evaluate causal assumptions and mechanisms more rigorously when theory testing, and likewise incorporate methods that can better assess these intermediate processes, such as open text responses and process tracing.",

    "description": "In academia, a major field of knowledge production, the quality of interactions among coworkers plays a critical role. Negative ties, such as conflicts or avoidance between researchers, can impede the progress of research projects, and adversely affect individual career advancement. Our study reveals that in the academic sector, these negative relations are not \"gender-neutral\" as they are experienced 47% more often by women. Using a large representative survey linked to official scientometric records from Hungary, we demonstrate that the conditions under which women and men experience these negative relations differ. Women experience more conflicts if they act as brokers in scientific collaborations, and fewer conflicts when they are members of cohesive groups. These factors, however, do not influence the number of conflicts for men. Thus, we can argue, that while being in a broker position holds the promise for scientific success, it comes with the price of more workplace conflicts for women. Regarding the role of gender diversity and cross-gender collaboration, we find that women report less negative relations when they collaborate with fellow women if they are a small minority, but in diverse fields, cross-gender collaboration comes with fewer conflicts.",

It addresses gaps in HPT research by (a) linking HPT to theories and research from the social science disciplines on perspective taking and the self, and (b) proposing a way to analyze how different tasks may elicit different kinds of HPT. The framework is grounded in a study where four young adults thought aloud while taking the perspective of a victim or a perpetrator at the Salem Witch Trials and a Holocaust-era massacre. Four shifting \u201cself perspectives\u201d were identified, whereby participants thought as their present-day selves, constructed hypothetical and imagined past selves, and made timeless generalizations about humans. To demonstrate the utility of the framework, it is then used to consider how task characteristics may elicit differential use of the self perspectives. It is argued that close attention to these self perspectives is a novel and crucial way to bring nuance to the concept of HPT, and implications for multiple learning environments are discussed.",

With the increasing integration of GAI in everyday tasks, its potential to transform the learning experience has gained significant attention. However, concerns have been raised relating to the use of GAI as a threat to academic integrity, the lack of accuracy of its outputs, and its potential influence on critical engagement in learning. While HE institutions in the UK have warned against the unregulated use of AI-generated content, the prevailing approach is to guide students in the ethical and transparent use of GAI tools. This research, based on primary data from a questionnaire involving undergraduate and postgraduate students across several UK HE institutions, aims to explore student perspectives on issues such as plagiarism, reliability, and the impact of GAI on the learning process. The findings show that students who identify as men report a higher frequency of GAI usage than women and that international students have more liberal standards regarding academic integrity compared to their UK counterparts.",

    "link": "https://share.osf.io/preprint/E020B-1E6-215",
    "description": "Adverse life events are often understood as having negative consequences for mental health via objective hardships, which are worse for persons with less income. But adversity can also affect mental health via more subjective mechanisms, and here, it is possible that persons with higher income will exhibit greater psychological sensitivity to negative events, for various reasons. This article theorizes potential mechanisms of increasing sensitivity with income. The proposition is tested using the strategic case of spousal and parental bereavement among older US adults. The analyses find consistent evidence of increasing sensitivity of depressive symptoms with income. A series of robustness checks indicate that findings are not due to endogenous or antecedent selection. Further, exploratory analyses of mechanisms suggest that higher sensitivity among the affluent was driven by greater expectations and better relationship quality with the deceased. These findings problematize the conceptualization and assessment of human suffering in economically stratified societies.",

    "description": "The professionalisation of policing in the UK has evolved significantly, especially since 2012, with structural changes like the establishment of the College of Policing and the introduction of Police and Crime Commissioners. This paper explores the role of critical thinking in UK police public order training and its potential to enhance police professionalism. It examines professionalism through sociological frameworks, aligning the National Decision Model (NDM) used in police training with academic models such as Burch\u2019s Learning Stages of Competence and Leicester\u2019s Four Habits of Thought. The paper argues that embedding critical thinking within public order training enhances ethical decision making, problem solving, and adaptability, thereby reinforcing professional standards. It also considers the impact of recent changes in police entry routes, including a non degree pathway, on the ongoing professionalisation of the police service. Ultimately, the integration of critical thinking into training is deemed essential for advancing UK policing's professionalisation.",

    "description": "This paper investigates the interplay between fields, markets, and movements in the emergence and development of new cultural categories. While some scholars argue that the rise of new genres is driven by internal resource mobilization, others contend that external market and field environments can both constrain and enable their emergence and growth. Through a cross-national comparative study of electronic/dance music and its various genres from 1985 to 2005, we demonstrate that genre emergence and development are significantly influenced by their embeddedness in different field environments: the environment of proximate genres, the mainstream music market and the transnational field level. The impact of these field environments on the emergence and development of dance genres, however, varies by country. Notably, markets and movements are more strongly coupled in the UK and the Netherlands compared to the US. In both European countries, the mainstream success of genres drives their development through a mechanism of differentiation, leading to the creation of new and distinct genres as a reaction against increased visibility in the charts. These findings highlight multiple ways in which markets and genre movements can interact, enriching our understanding of how new cultural categories emerge.",

    "description": "Objective: This study explores educational heterogeneity in direct workplace peer effects on fathers\u2019 parental leave usage over time, aiming to understand which fathers in which contexts are influenced by their peers. Background: Family policies increasingly encourage fathers to take parental leave to boost maternal employment and paternal childcare involvement. Yet many fathers use less than their entitlement. Limited studies suggest workplace peers may encourage fathers to use (more) leave, but the evidence is mixed, leaving uncertainty about who is influenced and when. Method: This study utilizes Finnish full-population administrative registers and linked employer-employee data on fathers\u2019 leave uptake in 2009\u20132019, covering 124,953 births. Structural causal models and Bayesian multilevel logistic regression are used to investigate how preceding fathers\u2019 leave usage influences new fathers, and how the probability varies by education level, calendar time, and previous leave use in the workplace. Results: Findings indicate that peers\u2019 leave usage positively influences new fathers, with low-educated fathers more impacted by peers than highly educated fathers. Direct peer effects were strongest in workplaces with low prior leave uptake and diminished in high-uptake contexts, especially for skilled men. Conclusions: Workplace peer effects are a significant mechanism behind increasing leave uptake between policy reforms. In contexts with little information on leave consequences, workplace peers serve as important sources of information, but the information gain diminishes rapidly with increasing uptake. Learning from peers\u2019 experiences appears to be particularly important for low-educated men.",

    "description": "Recent evidence shows a considerable potential for individuals to intervene, their widespread willingness to do so but also sizeable barriers they face to reduce their environmental footprint.

Using a multi-level latent variable framework, we model the association between attitudes and a diverse range of environmentally significant actions and scale up the analysis to a cross-country setting using the 2017 wave of the Eurobarometer data. We find a moderate, positive association which holds beyond standard sociodemographic and country-level controls and exhibits an additive effect: higher attitudinal levels align with higher numbers of undertaken actions, including difficult, costly and high-impact ones. The attitudes-actions association is contingent on a country's economic affluence and individual socioeconomic status. This, we argue, is evidence of the limits of mitigation strategies which focus exclusively on attitudes-driven behavioral change without consideration for the influence of sociodemographic and country-level inequalities.",

To date, there has been no systematic synthesis of the extent to which Open Science reaches these aims. We use the PRISMA scoping review methodology to partially address this gap, scoping evidence on the academic (but not societal or economic) impacts of OS. We identify 489 studies related to all aspects of OS, including Open Access (OA), Open/FAIR Data (OFD), Open Code/Software, Open Evaluation, and Citizen Science (CS). Analysing and synthesising findings, we show that the majority of studies investigated effects of OA, CS, and OFD. Key areas of impact studied are citations, quality, efficiency, equity, reuse, ethics, and reproducibility, with most studies reporting positive or at least mixed impacts. However, we also identified significant unintended negative impacts, especially those regarding equity, diversity and inclusion. Overall, the main barrier to academic impact of OS is lack of skills, resources, and infrastructure to effectively reuse and build on existing research. Building on this synthesis we identify gaps within this literature and draw implications for future research and policy.",

    "description": "What does it imply to digitalise a state, who stands to benefit and at the expense of whom? Zooming in on the digital Danish state, what if digitalisation made life easier and effortless for cisgender people while making life more difficult and hostile for trans people by hindering their liveability and citizenship through deleting their medical journals, inviting them for the wrong medical tests, blocking them from their bank accounts, denying them access to digital state welfare services and digitally excluding their identities? Despite these ramifications for trans people, existing scholarship only meagerly analyses the complex entangled relationship between transness, colonial and cisnormative legacies, algorithmic systems and nation states with none of them investigating and mapping the digital case of Denmark. In this paper, I assess the state of algorithmic violence and trans (un)liveability underlying and produced by the digitalisation of Denmark, where I argue that Denmark acts as a state extension of algorithmic violence that forces trans people to exist in a precarious state of digital and material unliveability. Based on this, I present three aspects of my preliminary findings which include (1) Healthcare: Digital medical erasure, (2) Bank & Payments: Digital blocking, and (3) MitID & Data: Digital exclusion and glitches, that uncover the concerningly violent, oppressive and ominous conditions of living for trans people in digital Denmark.",

    "description": "This comment aims to clarify trends in the percentage of men in the United States who are childfree (i.e., do not have and do not want children). Bozick (2023) used data from the National Survey of Family Growth (NSFG) to examine trends in the percentage of men who are childfree during the first two decades of the 2000s, concluding that there was a considerable increase. However, these percentages were computed incorrectly. Data from the NSFG are re-analyzed, ensuring comparable sample universes by age, correctly applying sampling weights, and including data from 2002. Following a small decline between 2006 and 2015 (10.7%-12.1%), the percent of men who were childfree between 2015 and 2019 (14.2%-15.7%) returned to the levels observed in 2002 (14.3%). Bozick's (2023) original conclusion, that the percentage of men who are childfree has grown considerably, is inconsistent with these revised analyses. Childfree men, and childfree adults in general, are a large and understudied demographic group that warrants greater attention, but researchers should exercise caution when studying trends in childfree prevalence.",

Common explanations for the rise of these monopolies include external network effects, economies of scale, technological barriers to entry, user lock-in, and inadequate antitrust regulation. While these explanations may accurately describe the current situation, they are insufficient to fully explain the emergence of digital monopolies. This article presents an alternative historical-institutional perspective, arguing that the specific history of the Internet and the initial reluctance of Internet users to pay for services fundamentally shaped market conditions and made network externalities a central factor. From a historical-institutional perspective, it becomes clear that the specific course of change - including the multi-sidedness of digital platforms and the increasing decoupling of use and exchange values - is largely due to these initial market exchange conditions.",

    "description": "The relief of responsibility is a cornerstone that shapes capitalist market societies and manifests itself in three central aspects of this economic order: free wage labor, limited liability corporations, and market exchange. Free wage labor is a defining feature of capitalism, in which human labor is exchanged for monetary compensation. However, historical evidence shows that employers have often neglected their responsibilities to their workers, subjecting them to harsh and deplorable working conditions. This has led to government intervention in the form of legislation and social safety nets, effectively transferring responsibility to the state. Limited liability companies offer shareholders protection from personal liability, even in the event of corporate malfeasance. This allows for rapid capital expansion and economic growth in capitalist market economies, but it also shifts the burden of associated risk to society as a whole. Market exchange, characterized by bilateral transactions for mutual benefit, generates externalities that affect third parties. Examples include the consequences of environmental degradation and social inequality resulting from market exchange. In capitalist market societies, the relief of responsibility has a pervasive influence. It is important to be aware of this fundamental principle and its implications so that we can work to create a more just and equitable society.",

I argue that relying solely on parental education as a proxy for parents\u2019 skills provides an incomplete view of their human capital and may underestimate their role in social reproduction. Parents enhance their human capital through on-the-job learning, with occupation-specific expertise becoming integral to their skill sets. Using longitudinal family data (NLSY79-CYA) and the O*NET dataset, I employ two-way fixed effects, inverse probability weighting, and asymmetric fixed effects models. I exploit changes in mothers' occupation-specific skills when they switch jobs. Results indicate that when mothers transition to roles requiring more mathematical skills, their children\u2019s mathematical abilities improve. Similar trends are observed in literacy skills, although the effects are less consistently robust. Additionally, longer maternal job tenure amplifies these effects, which are primarily driven by increases in skills rather than decreases.

The results indicate that this educational reform reduced the influence of genetic factors on life chances. Moreover, individuals with a lower genetic predisposition to education particularly benefited from the reform.

    "description": "Over the past decade, social scientists have adapted computational methods for qualitative text analysis, with the hope that they can match the accuracy and reliability of hand coding. Traditional computational techniques require extensive pre-processing of text, stripping words of context to convert them into numerical inputs for algorithms not typically designed for text. The emergence of GPT and open-source generative Large Language Models (LLMs) has transformed this process by shifting from programming to engaging with models using natural language, potentially mimicking the in-depth, inductive and/or iterative process of qualitative analysis. In this paper, we test the ability of generative LLMs to replicate and augment traditional qualitative coding, experimenting with multiple prompt structures across four LLMs. We find that LLMs can perform nearly as well as supervised machine learning models in accurately matching hand-coding output. Moreover, using generative LLMs as a natural language interlocutor closely replicates traditional qualitative methods, indicating their potential to transform the qualitative research process, despite ongoing challenges.",

We find that HCV households at the nation-scale have been consistently more highly distributed among lower-Area Median Income (AMI) census tracts and racially or ethnically concentrated areas of poverty (RECAPs). We specifically consider the potential of affirmatively furthering fair housing within the HCV program to simultaneously boost overall distributions in higher-AMI census tracts and to decrease RECAP concentrations of HCV households, observing that targeted deployment of mobility-based interventions can significantly decrease the proportion of HCV households residing in RECAPs. We further consider the impact of small area fair market rents (SAFMRs) and state-level source-of-income protections on HCV household distributions, finding that both interventions may boost HCV households into higher-AMI census tracts.",

In light of the state of research on the relationship between financialization, democracy, and social conditions, it appears plausible that the processes of financialization, which contributed to the emergence of a crisis, were influenced by the financial crisis but not completely reversed. The changes in financial market regulation, which were implemented in response to the crisis, did not create pressure for a redesign of the financial system. Therefore, one cannot deduce a significant turning point in financial market regulation from the reform measures taken. However, there are clear indications that the financial crisis has had a lasting impact on the European integration process, trust in democracy, and the political culture. Accordingly, the financial crisis can be seen as a turning point in history, primarily due to its effects on social areas beyond the financial system.",

    "description": "While politicians often argue that economic sanctions can induce policy changes in targeted states by undermining elite and public support for the reigning government, the efficacy of these measures, particularly against non-democratic regimes, is debatable. We propose that, counterintuitively, economic sanctions can bolster rather than diminish support for the sanctioned government, even in non-democratic contexts. However, this support shift and its magnitude can differ across various political factions and depend on the nature of the sanctions. To empirically evaluate our theoretical expectations, we use supervised machine learning to scrutinize nearly 2 million tweets from over 1,000 Iranian influencers, assessing their responses to both comprehensive and targeted sanctions during Donald Trump\u2019s presidency. Our analysis shows that comprehensive sanctions generally improved sentiments toward the Iranian government, even among its moderate oppositions, rendering them more aligned with the state's stance. Conversely, while targeted sanctions elicited a milder rally-around-the-flag response, the identity of the targeted entity plays a crucial role in determining the scale of this reaction.",

Quality appraisal of scientific-based policy recommendations is crucial, whether within the context of a systematic review or not. The ECR-P (Evidence Communication Rules for Policy) critical appraisal tool is used to assess the quality of both the recommendations and their evidence base putting policymakers, as the end users, centre stage. This tool was developed by a diverse group of researchers and stakeholders, taking into account existing critical appraisal tools. ECR-P is structured in five domains, based on the five rules of evidence communication. The domains include 25 signalling questions addressing aspects of internal and external validity as well as quality of communication. Domain-based judgment is derived from responses to the signalling questions and an accompanying algorithm, followed by overall quality judgement. ECR-P provides a focused, standardized and transparent approach to assessing the quality of scientific-based policy recommendations in any scientific field. ECR-P critical appraisal tool was designed to fit with the systematic reviewing process but also as a stand-alone tool.

    "link": "https://share.osf.io/preprint/E0008-F6C-898",
    "description": "Wealth is a key dimension of socioeconomic status (SES) and its intergenerational transmission, with parental wealth positively affecting children's educational outcomes. Previous research, however, has been limited to a small number of countries, and effect sizes that are hardly comparable across institutional contexts. Furthermore, the specific role of different wealth components remain unclear. This study addresses these gaps by comparing wealth gaps in education \u2013 measured as enrolment in post-secondary education \u2013 and examining the role of various wealth components across 15 European countries using harmonized data from the Household Finance and Consumption Survey. We find significant wealth gaps in education in all countries. In 10 countries, these gaps remain after controlling for other dimensions of parental SES. Regarding net wealth, our study documents substantial education gaps in Southern and Eastern European and smaller gaps in most Continental countries. In most countries, real wealth is the primary driver of these educational disparities. Conversely, the association between debt and post-secondary enrolment varies from positive to negative across countries. Our findings highlight the importance of parental real assets for education and the ambivalent and context specific role of debt.",

    "description": "Depending on the measures, methods, and sample applied, estimated contributions of genetic and environmental factors to individual differences in SES vary substantially. In the current study we use register based measures of educational attainment, occupational prestige, income, and wealth, across four genotype and family-based heritability methods in the same population-wide sample consisting of >170,000 Norwegian parents aged 35-45. Education consistently had the highest heritability, followed by occupational prestige. Shared environmental contributions were particularly strong for educational attainment and wealth. The \u2018missing heritability\u2019 was prevalent between family- and individual-based designs. Multivariate covariance analysis revealed commonality in genetic and familial environmental factors, but not in individual-specific factors. As we minimize differences in estimates due to measurement error and sample characteristics, our study is a reliable and valid source for comparing methods and indicators and for assessing the commonality between genetic and environmental factors influencing individual differences in SES.",

    "description": "The origin of modern financial economics can be traced to early discounted expected value solutions for the price of life annuities. In contrast to the single life annuity valuations attributed to de Witt and Halley, the computational complexity of joint life annuity valuation posed difficulties. Following a brief review of various joint life annuity specifications, a history of joint life annuity issuance and valuation in northern Europe from the 13th to the mid-18th century is provided. With this background, the 1671 correspondence from de Witt to Hudde on possible methods for valuing joint life annuities is detailed. These methods are contrasted with the geometric method described in Halley (1693); providing impetus for examination of the analytical approximations developed by de Moivre and Simpson.",

    "description": "This paper examines the writings of socialist scholars who played a pivotal role in shaping Hayek\u2019s perspective in TRTS, including William Beveridge, Stuart Chase, Henry Dickinson, Hugh Dalton, Evan Durbin, Oskar Lange, Harold Laski, Abba Lerner, Barbara Wootton, and the contributing authors in Findlay Mackenzie\u2019s Planned Society (1937). Many of these socialist thinkers held two main hypotheses. First, industrial concentration was inevitable under capitalism. Second, they argued that government ownership or control of key economic sectors was necessary to protect democracy from industrial consolidation in the capitalist system and to reduce political opposition to complete state ownership or control over the means of production. Despite sharing Hayek\u2019s concern for socialism\u2019s potential erosion of democratic freedoms, these socialist hypotheses have received much less scholarly attention than Hayek\u2019s TRTS. We conclude that Hayek formalized socialist scholars\u2019 fears and developed a well-defined hypothesis that central planning could threaten democratic freedoms.",

    "description": "Measurements of political polarization online have so far been largely focused on visible traces accessible through platformAPIs,while neglecting invisible traces not recorded or otherwise unavailable via online channels, which can reveal key aspects of political engagement online. Our study aims to address this gap by investigating the polarization measurement bias that arises when only visible engagement is considered. Using a combined dataset that links survey responses with YouTube digital traces froma representative sample of Hungarian Internet users (N=758), we uncover disparities at both user and channel levels. We find that users who visibly engage through commenting are more politically polarized. People tend to comment and subscribe to ideologically concentrated content, while viewing ideologically diverse content. We also notice that ideologically heterogeneous channels are more likely to share viewers than subscribers or commenters. Thus, the segregation of political channels may be overstated or simplified when relying solely on public comment data. Our results suggest that research using only visible engagement may overestimate the extent of polarization and the prevalence of echo chambers online. We highlight the benefits of data donation to address measurement bias in online political communication, and contribute to the polarization literature by providing a fresh evaluation of potential biases in platform-focused research.",

    "link": "https://share.osf.io/preprint/E0060-C0E-324",
    "description": "This paper applies complex systems theory to examine generative artificial intelligence (AI) as a contemporary wicked problem. Generative AI technologies, which autonomously create content like images and text, intersect with societal domains such as ethics, economics, and governance, exhibiting complex interdependencies and emergent behaviors. Using methodologies like network analysis and agent-based modeling, the paper maps these interactions and explores potential interventions. A mathematical model is developed to simulate the dynamics between key components of the AI-society system, including AI development, economic concentration, labor markets, regulatory frameworks, public trust, ethical implementation, global competition, and distributed AI ecosystems. The model demonstrates non-linear dynamics, feedback loops, and sensitivity to initial conditions characteristic of complex systems. By simulating various interventions, the study provides insights into strategies for steering AI development towards more positive societal outcomes. These include strengthening regulatory frameworks, enhancing ethical implementation, and promoting distributed AI ecosystems. The paper advocates for using this complex systems framework to inform inclusive policy and regulatory strategies that balance innovation with societal well-being. It concludes that embracing complexity enables stakeholders to better navigate the evolving challenges of generative AI, fostering more sustainable and equitable technological advancements.",

    "description": "Artificial intelligence (Al) tools have brought a shift and transformation in various sectors including education by providing innovative solutions to enhance learning experiences. One such Al tool that has gained significant attention is ChatGPT (Generative Pre-trained Transformer) for its ability to generate realistic texts based on user prompts. The integration of artificial intelligence (Al) tools like ChatGPT into education settings has revolutionized the learning process for students in higher education. ChatGPT, developed by OpenAl, is an Al-driven conversational model that generates human-like responses. This research delves into the factors that influence students to use ChatGPT for academic purposes and explores the multifaceted impacts it brings to the academic environment. By incorporating students\u2019 perspectives, this study identifies 6 factors encouraging the use of ChatGPT for academic purposes to students. Additionally, it seeks to assess Knowledge, Attitude, and Behavior (KAB) of students on the use of ChatGPT. The research methodology involved is qualitative approach where by document review, interviews were employed, focus group discussions, and observation. This research concludes that ChatGPT should remain being a sub tool for assisting students to advance their learning and not being an official tool for completing every work they are assigned at colleges otherwise students will graduate with low ability in generating their own ideas. The results suggest that Academic Institutions should emphasize the importance of critical thinking skills through various exercises and assignments that require students to analyze, evaluate, and solve problems independently. By encouraging critical thinking, students can develop their cognitive abilities beyond what AI tools like ChatGPT can provide.",

    "description": "The COVID\u201019 pandemic has impacted population movement around the world. Existing work has focused on countries of the Global North and restricted to the immediate effects of COVID-19 data during 2020. Data have represented a major limitation to monitor change in mobility patterns in countries in Latin American countries. Drawing on aggregate anonymised mobile phone location data from Meta\u2010Facebook users, we aim to analyse the extent and persistence of changes in the levels (or intensity) and spatial patterns of internal population movement across the rural-urban continuum in Argentina, Chile and Mexico over a 26-month period from March 2020 to May 2022. We reveal an overall systematic decline in the level of short- and long-distance movement during the enactment of nonpharmaceutical interventions in 2020, with the largest reductions occurred in the most dense areas. We also show that these levels bounced back closer to pre-pandemic levels in 2022 following the relaxation of COVID-19 stringency measures. However, the intensity of these movements has remained below pre-pandemic levels in many areas in 2022. Additionally our findings lend some support to the idea of an urban exodus. They reveal a continuing negative net balances of short-distance movements in the most dense areas of capital cities in Argentina and Mexico, reflecting a pattern of suburbanisation. Chile displays limited changes in the net balance of short-distance movements but reports a net loss of long-distance movements. These losses were, however, temporary, moving to neutral and positive balances in 2021 and 2022. This contrasts with a systematic pattern of net migration losses observed for the Metropolitan Region of Santiago over the last 20 years.",

    "description": "Does the media enhance issue accountability? Many argue it does by covering where politicians stand on policy. However, evidence of this process is limited and fails to address two alternatives. First, when informed about an issue by the media, people may change their own issue stance so it aligns with a politician they already support. Second, the public may ignore the news when it conflicts with party loyalty. We distinguish these alternatives using survey experiments and observational studies of local media and the public's use of issues to evaluate their members of Congress from 2006 to 2022. Across these settings local news increases the public's reliance on policy to evaluate politicians, affirming the media's contribution to issue accountability despite heightened polarization. These studies also highlight a mechanism behind this, showing news primarily changes views of legislators by reducing widespread uncertainty about their policy positions.",

Changes of research directions are thereby assumed to influence the evolution of science in general. Research has shown that such changes may also affect the success of individual scientists in their careers. However, the gender dimension of this aspect of career development is so far understudied. There is also need for more dynamic indicators to record and interpret career developments in macro data. This study combines the gender perspective with the introduction of new indicators. We selected more than 29,000 scientists in Physics & Astronomy and studied them over six decades using a bibliographic dataset from Scopus. We find that women are less likely to change research directions than their men counterparts, and that the research performance of women is less negatively affected by changing research directions.

Methodologically, we turn a large-scale bibliometric dataset (Scopus raw data) into a comprehensive, longitudinal data source for research on careers in science. The global science system is highly immobile: half of global top performers continue their careers as top performers and one-third of global bottom performers as bottom performers. Jumpers-Up and Droppers-Down are extremely rare in science. The chances of moving radically up or down in productivity classes are marginal (1% or less).

Drawing on educational census data (INVALSI) on mathematics and reading skills of more than half-a-million students in fifth and sixth grade, we develop a refined adjacent-grade discontinuity design (AGD) that, in contrast to previous applications, can separate the effects of school-year exposure from the effects of both chronological age and relative age in classroom. Results demonstrate that school exposure has clearly contributed to narrowing disparities in learning by social and migration background. However, schooling did not equalize gender gaps in neither reading or math. In fact, results suggest boys gaining comparably more from schooling.

    "description": "In recent years mental health has become a prominent topic in society. Mental health has often been ignored or integrated very minimally within society. However, one place in society constantly finds itself within the spotlight and forefront of mental health, educational institutions. These places have always been a prevalent part of this field due to their ability to help society at large through primary and secondary prevention. Primary prevention involves providing interventions to stop mental health issues from arising in the first place. This form of prevention teaches students healthy habits for their mental health and helps prevent illnesses. Secondary prevention involves preventing the further growth of mental health issues through prevention after the issue has already been diagnosed. Both prevention methods are utilized across the broad spectrum of students schools carry. Due to this broad spectrum, schools have been the grounds for many famous studies conducted by many famous scientists. In recent years, more and more money has been put into furthering mental health resources at schools. Legislation such as the Mental Health Services Grant Program provided 144 million to schools for mental health resources. However, the question becomes, how are these mental health resources being utilized? This correlational study aims to address the current gap in research for a need for data that is not diluted due to many confounding variables and provides information on trends of utilization of resources provided by school districts. To accomplish this we utilized vast surveys with each high school's Ohio State University clinician and Social Worker. This study collected responses from each staff member each time they met with a student on topics discussed and general demographics. This data was finally analyzed and tested to find general trends within the central Ohio school district. Some of the major findings and trends included that sophomores are most likely to go to the staff for help, the number of students that made a certain number of staff visits decreases exponentially for each increasing visit, women are more likely to go for help, and Caucasians are most likely to go for mental health. Further analysis by the school\u2019s OSU Clicican and Social worker revealed more data such as Asians almost always are the least represented in mental health cases despite their proportion of the student body. Further anxiety and stress are the most commonly discussed topics between staff and students. This data provides a basic understanding of the relationship between mental health and high school students. This could be the gateway to the effective application of solutions presented in primary and secondary prevention studies. Furthermore, a better understanding of how mental health issues affect the student body can result in more efficient utilization of funding and resources by school districts and allow for more targeted interventions.

    "link": "https://share.osf.io/preprint/E0084-B66-F08",
    "description": "Expulsion or exclusion from school is a common event in the lives of people who have experience of the criminal justice system. Exclusion underpins the \u2018school-to-prison pipeline\u2019 and is, accordingly, one of the most contentious policies used in education systems. Critics of exclusion powers claim that it is a direct cause of later offending behaviour, among other adverse outcomes, while supporters of this power argue that it is necessary for maintaining school discipline and safety. Evidence for or against a causal effect of exclusion on offending is inhibited by random allocation of exclusion not being available on ethical grounds and the generally low internal validity of studies in this area. To advance understanding of the causal connection between school exclusion and offending \u2013 specifically, serious violent offending \u2013 this study leverages a recent national linkage of educational and criminal justice records in England to emulate a randomised controlled trial using a target trial framework. Across more than 20,000 matched pairs of excluded and not excluded children, within twelve months of target trial entry, the hazard ratio for serious violence was 2.04 (95% CI: 1.83, 2.28) and for homicide/near-miss homicide was 2.36 (95% CI: 1.07, 5.20). We discuss the implications of these findings for theory and policy in education and criminal justice as well as discussing the extent to which the observed relationships can be considered causal.",

    "link": "https://share.osf.io/preprint/E019F-823-4FD",
    "description": "Research on instability has focused on how discrete, unitary forms of instability, like residential or household change, hurt families. Similarly, unauthorized legal status is associated with negative outcomes for immigrant families. There has been less exploration of how the experience of instability changes when those experiencing it, must also contend with undocumented status. Thematic analysis of 50 semi-structured interviews with undocumented and DACA-recipient immigrants suggests that respondents and their families experience \u201cnested instability\u201d, the interaction and compounding of nation-state, residential, and household transitions. This nested form of instability simultaneously destabilize immigrant lives at both the national and household societal levels. In addition, lacking a regular legal status hurt respondents\u2019 ability to cope with nested instability by restricting access to economic resources, institutions and services, and deportation protection. Future research on instability and mixed-status families should consider the form of instability that these families face and how it complicates the process of adapting to a changing national context. Immigration policy and services should also consider the many components of nested instability to better serve migrant families.",

    "description": "French Pragmatism or the Pragmatic Sociology of Critique (PSC), offers a valuable framework to analyse the argumentations of ordinary actors within situations of public dispute. However, due to the PSC\u2019s inherent (rationalistic) focus on providing a \u2018practical grammar of the political bond\u2019 (see Blokker & Brighenti 2011) the more disruptive processes of such disputes as well as the role of emotion(s), have remained under-explained in the overall PSC literature and hence the question as to \u2018why regimes shift\u2019. In an attempt to address these particular deficits, this paper extends the existing PSC framework by means of suggestive actions and emotive speech, offering them as additional analytical categories alongside the existing orders of worth. After operationalizing this extension into a semi-standardized neopragmatist discourse analysis, two case-studies that applied this new approach will be presented in its support. With this paper I am attempting to provide a semi-standardized PSC-based method that allows for the investigation of all \u2018real-world\u2019 (occidental) situations of public dispute, including those that cause \u2018political breaks\u2019.",

Black Americans experience higher age-specific mortality rates than White Americans throughout most of the life course, but this puzzlingly reverses at advanced ages. The leading explanation for the Black-White mortality crossover centers around selective mortality over the life course. Black Americans who survived higher age-specific mortality risk throughout their life course are highly selected on robustness, and have lower mortality than White Americans in late life. However, skeptics argue the Black-White mortality crossover is simply a data artifact from age misreporting or related data quality issues. We use large-scale linked administrative data (N = 2.3 million) to document the BlackWhite mortality crossover for cohorts born in the early 20 th century. We find evidence the crossover is not a data artifact and cannot be uncrossed using sociodemographic characteristics alone.",

Technologically infused infrastructures of buildings, transport and communication together with time based obligations of work and recreation intertwines with the physical spaces of built environment and human coexistence to create complex layers of \u2018being\u2019 in place. We have begun to explore being and belonging in place through the exploration of self through literature in the context of a student-tutor research partnership entitled Reading and Writing the City, based in a final year undergraduate study module.

    "description": "Scholars substantially contribute to innovation in knowledge economies. Identifying where scholars come from and move to is a core focus of the recent literature. However, whether collaboration networks of scholars affect where they move next is understudied. Studies which do consider scholarly migration and collaboration in tandem report paradoxical findings. We take a two pronged approach, considering both how spatial representations of mobility and collaboration networks compare and how collaboration patterns of mobile authors relate to their movement between institutions. We selected a random sample of authors worldwide from Scopus 2020 data based on number of publications, corresponding authorship, publication in top-ranked journals, and mobility status to construct comparable control/observation groups. Our results enabled us to resolve the paradoxical effect between collaboration and mobility. We found that while the histories of these two variables are highly similar across groups, embedding representations of collaboration are more densely packed than those for mobility which could indicate higher costs of mobility than collaboration. Authors who are mobile or identified as top performers, top 1\\% based on our selection criteria, are more likely to have a higher number of collaborators. Furthermore, though few authors collaborate only before or after a mobility event, collaboration increases leading up to a mobility event and the majority of publications with a target institution are published prior to the initial move there. Hence our rigorous investigation using multiple methodologies show that the aggregate direction of effect is from collaboration to mobility. Our methodological framework opens up promising avenues for future research on individual level forecasting of scholarly migration and on global dynamics of academic talent circulation.",

Building on existing research and other reflections, including literature reviews, seven important and relevant arguments are raised. Among these are the ontological and epistemological foundations; by argument, designs should be separated from artifacts, and from designing and designers. In addition, the arguments include observations and critical points about terminology, longitudinal research and the evolution of designs and artifacts, evaluation of artifacts and designs, ethics, and education. With these critical arguments, the paper contributes to the disciplinary discussion in the design science field and information systems in general by elaborating problems that need attention.

    "description": "Double robust methods for flexible covariate adjustment in causal inference have proliferated in recent years. Despite their apparent advantages, these methods are rarely used by social scientists. It is also unclear whether these methods actually outperform more traditional methods in finite samples. This paper has two aims: It is a guide to some of the latest methods in double robust, flexible covariate adjustment using machine learning, and it compares these methods to more traditional statistical methods and flexible \"single robust\" methods. It does this by using both simulated data where the treatment effect estimate is known, and then by replicating some prominent articles in sociology that use simpler methods. Double robust methods covered include Augmented Inverse Probability Weighting (AIPW), Targeted Maximum Likelihood Estimation (TMLE), and Double/Debiased Machine Learning (DML). Results suggest that some of these methods do outperform traditional methods in a wide range of simulations, but only slightly. In particular, the top performers are TMLE and AIPW in conjunction with flexible machine learning estimators. But G-computation with the same flexible estimators obtains almost identical results, and simple regression methods have only slightly higher bias and are much more computationally efficient. In the article replications, the application of double robust methods substantively changes some, but not all, of the results, highlighting the importance of comparing performance from multiple estimators.",

    "description": "We argue that discriminatory practices may vary significantly across decision-makers, which allows for deeper insights into the mechanisms behind discrimination. We study this in the context of biased grading in schools. We develop a theory of teacher biases driven by heuristic beliefs stemming from concrete classroom experiences. Because teachers may also care about grade equality, such a mechanism can lead to either inequality-reinforcing or compensating biases in grading. Based on large-scale administrative data on Danish lower secondary students, we find strong evidence for highly heterogeneous teacher biases - up to 45% of teachers exhibit a bias that is of the opposite sign as the average bias. Furthermore, there is a robust and substantively large compensation effect. Teachers who experienced a visible demographic group (defined by gender or migration background) academically under-performing relative to a reference group show more positive bias towards that group than teachers where the same group over-performed. We find little evidence for alternative explanations of bias. To fully grasp discrimination, we must go beyond averages and consider the wide variety of biases shaped by individual experiences.",

    "description": "Open Science programs are structured educational, research and technical projects that support the application of Open Science practices in universities. While previous research on Open Science has focused on topics such as Open Access, data sharing and data reuse, a very limited number of studies examine the implementation of Open Science in knowledge institutions, such as universities. Consequently, we don\u2019t have a comprehensive understanding of how Open Science works in knowledge institutions such as universities. This article aims to bridge this gap by focusing on the monitoring and evaluation of Open Science programs. We present the outcome of an empirical study proposing a monitoring framework for Open Science programs. This framework, developed through semi-structured interviews and participant observations, was rigorously validated during two focus groups involving Open Science experts. The proposed monitoring framework comprises seven key themes: Open Science as an ecosystem, Epistemic Cultures, Governance, Technical Infrastructure, Funding, Open Science as a process, and Reflexivity. We describe the study\u2019s results using the responsive evaluation method, which is most suitable in complex social systems and is recognized as a learning process by the evaluation\u2019s stakeholders. This paper makes two key contributions to the interdisciplinary discussion on Open Science. Firstly, by examining the lack of research on the operationalization of Open Science programs in universities, this study highlights the necessity of adopting a comprehensive and organizational perspective. Secondly, by presenting a framework to help universities monitor their Open Science programs, this study tangibly contributes to the management of Open Science in universities and knowledge institutions.",

    "description": "Research has identified socioeconomic disparity in university enrollment due to a higher likelihood to stop applying after an initial rejection among individuals from less educated families. We investigate the role of education-linked genes alongside family background and experiencing mental illness and other major life events in predicting (re-)application to university. We further examine the later socioeconomic outcomes of individuals who are more persistent in their educational goals. Utilizing longitudinal genetically informed register data from Finland, we analyze a sample of 6,101 individuals born 1987-1990 followed up until 2018. The study uses parental polygenic scores to assess the genetic endowment to high educational attainment (EDU-PGS) combined with information on application behavior (1,683 individuals experienced rejection) and socioeconomic variables. Multinomial and binary logistic regression models and discrete time hazard models are employed. Our findings indicate an intricate interplay of genetic endowments, income and education of the parents, (re-)application behavior, and early adulthood income and occupational status. Individuals with a higher EDU-PGS were more likely to reapply after rejection, suggesting a genetic component in persistence in educational goals and application behaviors beyond family background. Mental illness did not have an effect over and above other included indicators on stop applying, and there was no evidence for the presence of gene-environment interactions. Moreover, application behavior mediated the influence of the polygenic score on occupational status in early adulthood. The study contributes to the broader equality of opportunity debate and shows how genes express themselves in our smaller or bigger decisions. The joint contribution of genetic and family factors has a crucial role in shaping educational trajectories and later socioeconomic outcomes.",

Recently, there has been an increasing interest in using language models to examine social aspects through social science lenses. However, critical computing scholars have shown that models embody specific societal values and perspectives. This inherent encoding of viewpoints means that when these models are employed in research, scholars might not reflect the worldview or use theoretical perspectives. To address this issue, our study explores the possibility of fine-tuning large language models with a specific Weltanschauung. Specifically, we incorporate the writings of Marx and Engels to fine-tune these models, aiming to infuse them with Marxist ideological terminology and worldview. We evaluate how these fine-tuned models differ in empirical analysis.

    "description": "Child abuse and neglect are consistently found at higher rates in families facing low income and income insecurity, and in contexts with lower public spending on children and families. However, child abuse and neglect, particularly as measured through engagement with child protective services, has deep intergenerational and institutional causes, casting doubt on the effectiveness of income transfers alone to reduce it. In 2018, Aotearoa New Zealand introduced a \u201cFamilies Package\u201d of policies, including a small, unconditional cash transfer to mothers with children under three years of age, which increased family income by 5\\% on average. Using four years of national administrative child protective services and hospitalization data and difference-in-difference models, we find that the introduction of the Families Package was associated with a 19\\% (OR: 0.81, CI: 0.80-0.81, p.value=0.003) reduction in overall referrals to family services in nonurgent cases of suspected maltreatment, without significant changes in urgent cases.

The Families Package likely also reduced neglect in single-mother families (OR 0.6, CI: 0.38 - 0.93, p.value=0.022). We find no statistically significant effects, however, on social worker findings of emotional or physical abuse, or for hospitalizations for traumatic brain injury.",

At the same time, other norms become more important both among scientists and journalists: transparency and contextualization of information.

    "link": "https://share.osf.io/preprint/E00A7-89E-50F",
    "description": "Large Language Models (LLMs) promise to transform the social sciences through cost-effective predictions of human behavior. However, despite growing evidence that LLMs can misrepresent such behavior, current approaches to studying causal effects with LLMs require researchers to assume that predicted and observed behavior are interchangeable. Instead, we argue that human subjects should serve as a gold standard to correct misrepresentations within a mixed subjects design. This paradigm offers valid and more precise estimates of causal effects at a lower cost than experiments relying solely on human subjects. We demonstrate\u2013and extend\u2013prediction-powered inference, a statistical method that instantiates the mixed subjects design. Our innovation is a power analysis for optimally choosing between informative but costly human subjects and less informative but cheap predictions of human behavior. Mixed subjects designs could enhance scientific productivity and reduce inequality in access to costly evidence on research questions by offering valid, precise, and cost-effective inferences on causal effects and other parameters.",

    "description": "Do individuals in the upper class have siblings with similar class positions to themselves? Using data based on the entire registered population in Norway, this article describes brothers\u2019 and sisters\u2019 class destinations with particular attention to the upper class and top wealth positions. The study first describes upper-class recruitment across families of different classes, finding similarities in siblings\u2019 social mobility. Concerning upper-class reproduction, first- and secondborn siblings from families with top wealth are particularly likely to both reach upper-class positions. Second, the paper describes how upper-class members tend to have siblings with similar class positions to themselves in terms of both vertical class and horizontal positions according to individuals\u2019 composition of cultural and economic capital. By adopting a class-theoretical framework for sibling outcomes, the work sheds light on the social connectedness between social class positions that emerge through intergenerational mobility. The wealthiest 0.2% are shown to have siblings who are disproportionally often not only situated in higher class positions, but also in the economic fraction of the upper and middle classes.",

    "description": "In this paper, we explore how members of the scientific community leave academic science and how attrition (defined as ceasing to publish) differs across genders, academic disciplines, and over time. Our approach is cohort-based and longitudinal: We track individual male and female scientists over time and quantify the phenomenon traditionally referred to as \u201cleaving science.\u201d Using publication metadata from Scopus\u2014a global bibliometric database of publications and citations\u2014we follow the details of the publishing careers of scientists from 38 OECD countries who started publishing in 2000 (N = 142,776) and 2010 (N = 232,843). Our study is restricted to 16 STEMM disciplines (science, technology, engineering, mathematics, and medicine), and we track the individual scholarly output of the two cohorts until 2022. We use survival analysis to compare attrition of men and women scientists. With more women in science and more women within cohorts, attrition is becoming ever less gendered. In addition to the combined aggregated changes at the level of all STEMM disciplines, widely nuanced changes were found to occur at the discipline level and over time. Attrition in science means different things for men versus women depending on the discipline; moreover, it means different things for scientists from different cohorts entering the scientific workforce. Finally, global bibliometric datasets were tested in the current study, opening new opportunities to explore gender and disciplinary differences in attrition.",

    "link": "https://share.osf.io/preprint/E0147-50E-7B6",
    "description": "In this research, the contributions of a highly productive minority of scientists to the national Polish research output over the past three decades (1992\u20132021) is explored. In almost all previous research, the approaches to high research productivity are missing the time component. Cross-sectional studies were not complemented by longitudinal studies: Scientists comprising the classes of top performers have not been tracked over time. Three classes of top performers (the upper 1%, 5%, and 10%) are examined, and a surprising temporal stability of productivity patterns is found. The 1/10 and 10/50 rules consistently apply across the three decades: The upper 1% of scientists, on average, account for 10% of the national output, and the upper 10% account for almost 50% of total output, with significant disciplinary variations. The Relative Presence Index (RPI) we constructed shows that men are overrepresented and women underrepresented in all top performers classes. Top performers are studied longitudinally through their detailed publishing histories, with micro-data coming from the raw Scopus dataset. Econometric models identify the three most important predictors that change the odds ratio estimates of membership in the top performance classes: gender, academic age, and research collaboration. The downward trend in fixed effects over successive six-year periods indicates increasing competition in academia. A large population of all internationally visible Polish scientists (N=152,043) with their 587,558 articles is studied. Implications for high-productivity studies are shown, and limitations are discussed.",

Using linked employer\u2013employee data from nine European and North American countries, we document that the segregation of immigrant-background workers in lower-paying jobs accounts for about four-fifths of immigrant\u2013native earnings differences. However, within-job pay inequality remains consequential in several countries.

    "description": "With targeted childcare initiatives and welfare-to-work programmes policy-makers have sought to address employment activation of lonemothers and negative outcomes for children in lone parent households. The present study examines non-parental childcare use and maternal employment among children living in lone and co-parent family situations at ages three and four and emotional and behavioural difficulties at ages four and five. The results demonstrate that negative outcomes associated with lone motherhood are explained largely bymother\u2019s age, education, material circumstances and area deprivation; and that maternal employment does not relieve lone mothers\u2019 disadvantages in a way that alleviates the risks of difficulties to their children.However, in any family constellation,mainly group-based formal pre-school childcare does have a positive impact on child difficulties compared to drawing on informal childcare arrangements as main provider. In addition, and specifically for the difficulties of children in lone mother family situations, any non-parental childcare \u2013 formal or informal \u2212 for at least twenty-five hours per week is beneficial. Study findings support policy agendas which tackle families\u2019 material hardship beyond promoting mothers\u2019 employment, and through investment in formal childcare provision, and also through arrangements allowing lone mothers to divide their weekly load of childcare with another main provider.",

We included a sample of 128 mathematics teacher educators in the survey through non-probability sampling.

Drawing on the social psychology and social science literature, it examines whether childhood behavioral traits measured by the Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire (SDQ) influence concerns about discrimination. Using the Growing Up in Ireland longitudinal dataset, the study shows that internalizing behaviors in childhood (such as loneliness and frequent worry) correlate positively with later concerns about discrimination, while externalizing behaviors (such as strong temperament and impulsivity) show a negative correlation. When analyzing whether the results are socially stratified, we show that they are more pronounced for native males. The results suggest that childhood experiences shape political attitudes before political preferences crystallize and underscore the importance of understanding the developmental origins of discrimination concerns.",

    "link": "https://share.osf.io/preprint/E01A7-B81-8C0",
    "description": "Farmers are often advised to hedge their commodity prices on the commodity futures exchange, without sound scientific evidence to support this. This paper questions this rash advice and analyzes the impact of various hedging strategies based on wheat futures for a large sample of farms in Germany. Historical simulation is used to evaluate the hedging efficiency for 2,197 German farms over a 21-year study period. Adopting a whole-farm economic risk approach, we use \u201cadjusted farm profit\u201d as performance indicator and measure for each of these farms which relative change in profit volatility would have been obtained by nine different hedging strategies. A cluster analysis was used to identify whether there are farm types that show particularly low or high hedging efficiencies. Contrary to expectations, hedging would not have reduced but slightly increased profit volatility in most cases and across different regions, farm types, and farm sizes. In addition, hedging would have led to a reduction in profit levels in most cases due to hedging costs and/or speculative losses. In other words, the majority of the farms would not have been able to \u201cbeat the market\u201d and hedging would have led to per-verse effects, as it would have caused costs, but instead of the desired reduction of whole-farm risk, it would have increased risk. This paper presents an in-depth analysis of the effects of hedging based on wheat futures contracts. Unlike previous hedging studies that used synthetic farm models or rather small samples, we use a whole-farm economic risk approach and conduct a large-scale study of 2,197 individual farms over a 21-year study period. The study results cast substantial doubt on the conventional wisdom that farmers should be more willing to include hedging as \u201cinnovative\u201d tool into their risk management.",

Using population-based experiments leveraging real-world interviews with extreme right activists on Sky News UK and Australia, we test if media exposure leads to higher agreement with extreme right statements. We also test if exposure affects perceptions of how many others agree with these statements. Our findings are consistent across both countries: exposure to uncritical interviews increases agreement with extreme statements and perceptions of broader support in the population. Testing the media strategy in the UK, we find that critical interviewing tarnishes the activist\u2019s image and reduces effects but still heightens perceived support for extreme statements. This study identifies a mechanism through which extreme political ideas spread and offers insights into media strategies to counteract persuasion and normalisation effects.",

    "description": "Large-scale cooperation among unrelated humans remains an evolutionary puzzle. Cultural group selection theory suggests that strong intergroup selection drives the evolution of cooperation, given substantial behavioral variation between groups. This study investigated payoff-biased imitation of successful out-groups as an intergroup selection process, specifically as an alternative to warfare-based mechanisms. We thus conducted two experiments manipulating exposure to cooperative out-group information in public goods games, demonstrating that cooperative behavior can indeed transmit across group boundaries, thereby influencing decision-making processes. However, this effect gradually diminished within groups, and transmitted cooperation was not likely to spread. Additionally, we performed a cross-cultural survey examining relationships between press freedom, which is a proxy for accessibility to out-group information, and different types of prosociality. The results revealed contrasting relationships, particularly in democratic countries: higher press freedom positively predicted impersonal prosociality (e.g., generalized trust) while negatively predicting personal prosociality (e.g., trust in family). These findings suggest that cultural processes such as payoff-biased imitation can facilitate the spread of cooperation beyond group boundaries, serving as a potential channel for intergroup selection. Finally, we discuss the implications for cultural group selection theory and additional mechanisms\u2019 potential role in sustaining within-group cooperation.",

This coexistence is contingent on the nature and frequency of human-animal interactions (HAI) that are primarily shaped by public attitudes and values. 2. We designed a questionnaire using the Wildlife Attitudes and Values (WAVS) and Wildlife Value Orientation (WVO) frameworks to investigate public attitudes and values to a feral megaherbivore, the water buffalo (Bubalus bubalis), living in and around the South Lantau region of Hong Kong. We collected 657 questionnaire responses (online = 550, in-person =107) and additional comments from 56 respondents who completed their questionnaire in person. 3. We conducted a principal component analysis using the questionnaire responses related to WAVS and WVO. Three key dimensions were found: Buffalo Appreciation, Social Benefits, and Tolerance, which accounted for 67.63% of the variance in the data. We conducted a thematic analysis of the additional comments to further explore how these dimensions contextualise public attitudes and values to buffalo. 4. Based on 472 responses where all demographic data (self-reported gender, age, district of residence, residency of South Lantau, ethnicity, education level, and place of birth) were available, we conducted logistic regression analyses to investigate the effects of these demographic characteristics on Buffalo Appreciation, Social Benefits, and Tolerance. We found significant associations between gender, district of residence, education level, and place of birth with Buffalo Appreciation, Social Benefits, and Tolerance, implying a complex interplay between public attitudes and values toward a feral animal and their relationships with the natural environment and ecosystem. Fifty-six respondents provided a total of 237 additional comments, highlighting Safety concerns and issues, Emotion and sentiment, and Livelihood impacts as key themes. 5. Studying public attitudes and values, such as appreciation for feral buffalo in Hong Kong, potentially points to methods for successful strategies using buffalo as \u2018agents\u2019 of conservation.

This process is located in a broader context of practices that shape the ritual in a multi-sensory environment that imprints a process of memory and remembrance in the brain. Moreover, the flexibility of this ritual to take globalized influences, foods and discourses (as in the names of recipes) allows it to perpetuate itself and thus continue to play a central role in the calendar of festivities in Mexico. Food is in this sense a gustatory-visual-olfactory social artifact that is valued and requires an extra investment and effort to be made. An extra effort that is necessary as it links the need for nourishment of the dead that is fulfilled by the alive while they remember. This process of remembrance allows for the dead to be part of the social realm of the alive. Food acts, in this sense as a mediator. By exciting multiple senses it imprints the brain with memories and the calendar with a festivity to look for, one that has transcended globalization, clashes of cultures, uneven structures of power and tourism.

(2) How is the food prepared and what are the differences between the amateur chefs (contestants) and the professional chefs (judges) and how those differences are highlighted by gender differences in which the male chef is contrasted with the female chef.

I argue that the image that is represented in MCC is a highly centralized version of the nation that depicts a modern nation in the supermarket as the modern place to obtain food, a dominant male urban chef, and urban areas that entitle themselves with a sense of omnivorousness when it comes to international and national food knowledge. The image of National cuisine that arises is a fragmented and skewed one that doesn\u2019t take into account the rural, the female chefs and the regions.",

    "description": "In June 16 2014 Starbucks opened its first store in Bogot\u00e1, Colombia. This paper analyzes how the Colombian identity as a nation of coffee shaped the reaction by the major Colombian newspaper before and after the arrival of Starbucks. In order to frame my research I relied on secondary sources to understand the history of the Colombian coffee culture and the three main areas that contributed to shape Colombia\u2019s identity as a coffee nation: (1) a small scale production from which thousands of families depended, (2) an avid global market for coffee and (3) the successful establishment of FNC in 1927 which confronted the 1980\u2019s coffee crisis by changing its strategy as a raw coffee producer into a consumer oriented brand as a measure after the 1989 coffee crisis. On the other hand, the relation between coffee and identity in Bogot\u00e1. Its major urban center, revolves around notions of semi-public spaces usually dominated by man. With this framework in mind I analyzed my primary sources on Eltiempo.com during 2014 by looking at the anticipation to the arrival of Starbucks and to what happened during the arrival and after it. I focused on two aspects (1) how the Starbucks arrival contrasts with the acquisition of OMA, by a Costa Rican investment fund, which raised no comments and (2) the strategy that Starbucks adopted in order to enter the Colombian market by focusing on a discourse of respect and help to the Colombian growers. I argue that particular historical responses were important in shaping the Identity of Colombia as a nation of coffee producers but that this has not been translated into the realm of consumption, in spite of the recent efforts by the FNC, thus on the consumption side the arrival of Starbucks will increase consumption and perhaps foster a consumer oriented culture of coffee.",

    "description": "The emergence of nation-states in Central and Eastern Europe at the beginning of the 20th century created the need to manage ethnic diversity and issues with drawing boundaries between ethnic communities. This resulted in the minority activism, aimed not only at protecting the interests of minorities, but also at ensuring their survival. This article focusses on the latter aspect. The article shows that research on country-level minority activism helps better understand majority-minority relations and their impact on the society by analysing the example of interwar Estonia. The German minority elite\u2019s perceptions of ethnicity will be discussed, based on the documentation reflecting the inclusion policy of the German Cultural SelfGovernment, the autonomous institutional body of the German minority in Estonia. The article demonstrates the remarkably constructivist views of the German minority elite and explains their genesis and background. It will be argued that first, German elite\u2019s constructivist perceptions had historical roots; second, the elite needed to be pragmatically open rather than primordially protectionist for their dwindling community to survive; and third, they had no reason for protectionism stemming from the fear of malicious infiltration of members of other ethnic groups. Since such an open inclusion policy turned out to be relatively successful, it can be concluded that the German minority, which formed the ruling elite in Estonia earlier centuries, continued to be attractive, and this, in turn, caused significant social tensions, making the Estonians, now being in a dominant position and in the numerical majority, doubt their own survival. The results of this article ultimately highlight the relevance of instrumentalisation of ethnic ambiguities in forming minority activism and drawing boundaries between majority and minorities.",

    "link": "https://share.osf.io/preprint/E001C-333-16C",
    "description": "An unexpected, symbolic, vivid, and personally captivating experience led me to write this book. This involved my capturing many open-ended hierarchies of information associated with that intuitive experience. I was at first drawn to notions of \u201cconditional\u201d and \u201cunconditional\u201d human love. As I dug deeper into describing my experience, these notions transformed into the more specific terms of \u201cconditional-only human interests\u201d and \u201cboth-and human love.\u201d Building upon published data and intuitive logic, I recognized that \u201cconditional human interests\u201d can and do often unfold without the presence of any altruism by social subjects toward their social objects. In contrast, the presence of human altruism cannot and does not occur without the simultaneous presence of \u201cconditional human interests.\u201d A ubiquitously-asymmetrical, holarchically-systematized, human-interaction dynamic has, since antiquity, dynamically characterized and circulated around this asymmetrical yet holarchical and hierarchical exchange among people. This is herein postulated and asserted to be operating cross-culturally. Data, utilizing an Integral, cross-disciplinary, socio-evolutionary perspective, helps organize this report. I assert that conditional human interests are universally recognized and/or offered among all people, in each and every social interaction or circumstance. In contrast, what is socio-evolutionary defined \u201clove\u201d will not always be recognized and/or offered within every interaction or circumstance. Accurate identification of \u201clove\u201d from a socio-evolutionary perspective requires a \u201cboth-and\u201d quality between parties, meaning that personal interests AND altruism must both concomitantly occur to qualify as a \u201clove\u201d interaction. Love, described as \u201cboth-and\u201d in nature, using Love Value Orientation (LVO) theory terminology, creates a uniquely different kind of inter-holonic interaction field in comparison to \u201cconditional-only\u201d human interest interaction fields. \u201cBoth-and\u201d interaction fields afford parties an ultimately greater variety of satisfying and sustaining options. These will tend to be more aesthetically beautiful, inspiring, and ultimately more inclusively empowering options. These \u201cboth-and\u201d options can also be more fine tuned than simply conditional options. Personal interests with altruism, when both evident within a given individual or population, will arguably occur in various kinds of balance. Strategic expressions of conditional interests and unconditional altruism, in various forms of balance, are argued to be cardinal ingredients of a simultaneously destructive, constructive, and creatively evolving human process of individual and collective development. Within this context, I ask: \u27a2 To what extent are conditions for human dignity being included, locally, regionally, and world-wide in what we humans are individually and collectively creating? Humans are unique. Among all biotically embedded holons known to humankind, people possess, by far, the most complex capacities for interior and external perspective-taking and information-processing. Given the ubiquitous presence of people in relation to each and every human affair, the uniquely cardinal role of human consciousness \u2014 individual and collective \u2014 can be noted in regard to virtually all human interests. The heuristic nature of intuitive human-to-human love consciousness is explored as a common, relatively stable predisposition across social circumstances, yet what can be a fluid and situation-specific dimension of interaction associated with altruism. To what extent might this intuitive \u201cboth-and\u201d human-to-human love consciousness represent an increasingly conscious -- and increasingly cross-cultural -- aspect of the human pursuit and organization of successful human affairs locally and globally, short-term and long-term? Integral clarifications will be particularly advantageous here.",

    "link": "https://share.osf.io/preprint/E01EC-6E5-37B",
    "description": "While Sociology has historically engaged with the transformative social experiences associated with technology since the Industrial Revolution, the study of civilian \u201cdrones\u201d (or unmanned aerial vehicles) in their current societal ubiquity has surprisingly remained neglected. This dissertation addresses this gap by taking the under-examined practice of civilian drone operations as its object of analysis and conducting an in-depth inquiry into civilian drone culture. Through an abductive, multi-sited investigation of drone pilots\u2019 experiences, this study provides a sociologically-informed understanding of the processes that structure the identities and social practices of civilian drone pilots, as well as their role in the shaping of technonatural knowledge within the rapidly expanding \u201cDrone Society\u201d. By doing so, this dissertation positions civilian drones and their pilots as central components within an emergent social order, extending them far beyond their militaristic contexts, regulatory concerns, and other technical domains. Through its research questions and an interdisciplinary approach, the dissertation examines the mechanisms that concern the process of \u201cbecoming\u201d a drone pilot, the nature of work within the drone society, the relationship between precarity and the use of civilian drones, and finally, the influence of drone media (i.e., drone photographs, videos, and other data) on perceptions of both, built and natural environments. Analysis of data collected through 29 in-depth qualitative interviews, participant observation, and digital ethnography performed over a year reveals how civilian drone pilots construct and negotiate their identities within broader technocultural networks and how civilian drone culture is often marked by a spirit of collaboration, economic informality and the exchange of specialized forms of knowledge. This dissertation\u2019s findings also furnish an examination of the gendered dimensions of drone operation, highlighting significant exclusionary practices that result from the masculinization of technical expertise and novel forms of precarity that civilian drone pilots are exposed to daily. Crucially, the analysis reveals how the use of drones and drone media creates dual perceptions of environments (on a physical and digital level), and how an interplay between physical and digital realities fosters new forms of spatial knowledge, awareness, and experience, thus reshaping how people perceive and engage with their surroundings. Collectively, these findings underscore how drones are redefining social organization, leisure, work, and epistemic practices, thus positioning them as influential actors in the contemporary sociotechnical landscape.",

Our sample consists of 5,518 higher ed protests involving 585 universities and colleges between 2012 and 2018. We find higher ed protests most commonly concern university governance, anti-racism, and labor. Protest frequency is patterned by the academic calendar. Large protest waves reveal specific issues animating mass mobilizations: racist police violence, racially hostile campus climates, and Trump\u2019s election in the United States, and public tuition, austerity, and labor conditions in Canada. University administrations and police usually avoided extensive intervention during protests.

    "description": "Background: In social sciences, ensuring a high level of instrument validation is crucial for upholding the principles of scientific rigor and maintaining the overall quality of research. Objectives: To develop and evaluate an AI chatbot and website for instrument validation, assess their impact on instrument validity improvement, and analyze user perceptions. Methods: Adopting a quantitative design, the study was anchored on the developed Research Instrument Validation Framework (RIVF) of Villarino (2024). Moreover, it was evaluated through users' perceptions (n=100) by administering an online survey, whereby the employment of paired t-tests used contrasting instrument validity-pre-vs post-RIVF scores, and one-way ANOVA was used to determine if a relationship existed between users' perceptions and overall improvement in instrument validity. A G*Power analysis indicated that there was sufficient statistical power for the analyses: for paired t-tests, it was 99.73% (n = 100, dz = 0.5, \u03b1 = 0.05), and for one-way ANOVA, 80.95% (n = 100, f = 0.25, \u03b1=0.05, four groups). All data were analyzed using IBM SPSS version 26. Results: Post-RIVF use, all the validity domains showed significant improvements (p<0.001), but the primary considerable improvement was in construct validity [Mean difference=1.20\u00b10.60, t(49)=14.14]. Participants perceived the AI chatbot as more useful [4.30\u00b10.70 vs. 3.80\u00b10.80, p<0.001] compared to the RIFV website. Conclusion: This AI-powered milieu indicates a potential for increasing the validity of research instruments in RIVF, while an AI chatbot efficiently increments the construct validity. These findings would infer that using AI technologies potentially enhances the quality of research instruments in the social sciences alongside traditional validation methods.

    "description": "Objectives This article explores the scale and seasonal patterns of mobility at the complex settlement site of Q\u0131zqala during the Middle Bronze Age (2400\u20131,500 BCE). By integrating human bone, teeth, and environmental samples this research tests the hypothesis of the persistent importance of community-wide seasonal pastoral transhumance during the early formation of complex settlement systems of the South Caucasus. Methods This research applies stable oxygen and radiogenic strontium isotope analyses on incremental samples of human tooth enamel, bulk tooth enamel, and bone to resolve mobility patterns. Sequential and bulk sampling techniques elucidate seasonal and residential mobility behaviors. Extensive environmental isotope samples of plant and water were collected through regional survey and establish local and regional isotopic baselines, which are compared to human isotope analysis results. Results Q\u0131zqala individuals exhibit low isotopic variability compared to regional contemporaries. 87Sr/86Sr ratios from human remains indicate seasonal and residential isotopic variability within the baseline ranges of local landscapes. \u03b418O values display erratic patterns, but correspond to seasonal variability with fluctuations between highland and lowland altitudinal zone baseline values. Conclusions Results suggest that isotopic analysis of multiple elements and sequential enamel samples offers finer resolution on the complexities of human mobility strategies and elucidate the daily lives of often overlooked mobile populations. Higher resolution of individual mobility reveals shared routine behaviors that underscore the importance of diverse social collaborations in forming complex polities in the South Caucasus.",

    "description": "The causes, consequences, and timing of the rise of moralizing religions in world history have been the focus of intense debate. Progress has been limited by the availability of quantitative data to test competing theories, by divergent ideas regarding both predictor and outcomes variables, and by differences of opinion over methodology. To address all these problems, we utilize Seshat: Global History Databank, a large storehouse of information designed to test theories concerning the evolutionary drivers of social complexity in world history. In addition to the Big Gods hypothesis, which proposes that moralizing religion contributed to the success of increasingly large-scale complex societies, we consider the role of warfare, animal husbandry, and agricultural productivity in the rise of moralizing religions. Using a broad range of new measures of belief in moralizing supernatural punishment, we find strong support for previous research showing that such beliefs did not drive the rise of social complexity in world history. By contrast, our analyses indicate that intergroup warfare, supported by resource availability, played the most significant role in the evolution of both social complexity and moralizing religions. Thus, the correlation between social complexity and moralizing religion would seem to result from shared evolutionary drivers, rather than from strong direct causal relationships between these two variables. The data, methods, and results presented in this paper have been made publicly available online for others to inspect and critique, allowing additional analyses to be run and alternative assumptions to be tested, prior to peer review and publication.",

    "description": "In philosophy, and especially in ethics, reflective equilibrium (RE) is often considered a powerful method for obtaining beliefs that mutually support each other, are justified by evidence, and are backed by good reasons. Beisbart, Betz, and Brun (2021) have introduced a formal model of reflective equilibrium based on the theory of dialectical structures Betz (2013), which they use as a methodological tool to understand the method of reflective equilibrium better. This report is an outcome of the research project 'How far does Reflective Equilibrium Take us? Investigating the Power of a Philosophical Method' and summarizes the findings of assessing the model thoroughly by numerical investigation. We simulate RE processes for a broad spectrum of model parameters and initial conditions and use four different model variants (including the original model). We analyze the dependence of simulation results on different parameters and assess the models' conduciveness towards consistency, and ability to reach global optima and full RE states. The results show that the models' behavior depends crucially on the specifics of the simulation setup (e.g., the sentence pool size and $\\alpha$ weights). We can, therefore, not draw any general conclusions about the overall performance of the model variants. Rather, the specifics of the context in which an RE model is used must be considered to choose a specific model. Finally, we identify some critical knowledge gaps we cannot close with this report that call for further research into RE modelling.",

    "description": "The digital revolution has ushered in many societal and economic benefits. Yet access to digital technologies such as mobile phones and internet remains highly unequal, especially by gender in the context of low- and middle-income countries. While national-level estimates are increasingly available for many countries, reliable, quantitative estimates of digital gender inequalities at the subnational level are lacking. These estimates, however, are essential for monitoring gaps within countries and implementing targeted interventions within the global sustainable development goals, which emphasize the need to close inequalities both between and within countries. We develop estimates of internet and mobile adoption by gender and digital gender gaps at the subnational level for 2,158 regions in 118 low- and middle-income countries (LMICs), a context where digital penetration is low and national-level gender gaps disfavoring women are large. We construct these estimates by applying machine-learning algorithms to Facebook user counts, geospatial data, development indicators, and population composition data. We calibrate and assess the performance of these algorithms using ground-truth data from subnationally-representative household survey data from 31 LMICs. Our results reveal striking disparities in access to mobile and internet technologies between and within LMICs, with implications for policy formulation and infrastructure investment. These disparities contribute to a global context where women are 21% less likely to use the internet and 17% less likely to own mobile phones than men, corresponding to over 385 million more men than women owning a mobile phone and over 360 million more men than women using the internet.",

    "description": "Long-term symptoms continuing after a Covid-19 infection have emerged as a complex medical, scientific, and economic problem in numerous societies around the world. Moreover, how this problem is addressed may have important consequences in terms of trust or lack thereof in scientific, medical, and political institutions. Drawing on three studies of patient experiences with Covid-19 recovery in the United States, Brazil, and China, we find significant variation in how patients talk about their condition in the three countries. While American patients embrace Long Covid as a disease identity, Chinese patients were wary of using the term, while Brazilian patients were somewhere between the two. These differences in naming become intelligible within a grid composed of three cross-cutting axes of comparison: (1) the symbolic politics of disease classification and representation; (2) institutionalized channels of healthcare and welfare state provision; and (3) position in the global geopolitical and knowledge production system. We conclude that even if global public health institutions manage to institutionalize Long Covid as a standard disease category, there will remain significant differences between countries in the meaning and scope of the condition due to the differences in the politics of expertise in each country.",

Among those low in engagement, NSC is directly related to left-leaning economic preferences, since social welfare can be regarded as insurance. Among those high in engagement, NSC predicts right-wing economic preferences, since engaged individuals high in NSC take cues from right-leaning elites suggesting that support for redistribution is inconsistent with conservative political identities. Examining comparative European public opinion, we argue that this \u2018reversal\u2019 is less applicable to universal basic income (UBI), since the latter is an unconditional benefit that detaches welfare provision from specific situations of risk (e.g., unemployment insurance). This should shift individuals to think of provision in terms of moral hazard (e.g., work avoidance) in the context of UBI. Using Round 8 of the European Social Survey, we test and find support for several hypotheses based on this argument.",

    "link": "https://share.osf.io/preprint/E0253-57F-605",
    "description": "Background: A recent development in bioarchaeology is the big-data approach. This comes with the production of pan-continental and/or multiregional databases of bioarchaeological information, such as isotope, osteological, ancient DNA (aDNA), and radiocarbon data (14C). There are significant advantages in this approach, including the availability of large datasets of scientific data. The big-data approach, however, also faces challenges, which we address through MARGA\u2014the MARGinality in Archaeology database. Data: MARGA is a database we built for the study of marginality in the past, a topic of growing interest in bioarchaeology. Currently, MARGA includes ~1000 human individuals and ~3000 associated specimens, such as objects and faunal remains. It covers two main regions in Italy, c.1200 BC\u201325 AD: Veneto in the northeast, and the Apennine mountain range in the centre-south. MARGA gathers osteological, archaeological, taphonomic, and isotope data (\u03b413C, \u03b415N, \u03b418O and 87Sr/86Sr). This is accompanied by contextual information on chronology, geography, zooarchaeology, palaeobotany, epigraphy, and scholarly literature. Methods: MARGA was built as an Access relational database with a main table where we stored information on the sampled human burials (table 1: Fig. 1). This table provided a path to three secondary tables with accompanying information on osteology (table 2), material culture (table 3) and isotope data (table 4). Data were sampled from existing scientific literature, archaeological reports, and raw datasets we produced ourselves. Access afforded storing and querying both numerical and textual information. Statistical and contextual analyses on the sampled data addressed variables such as ritual, burial practice, nutrition, mobility, provenance, palaeopathology, and palaeoecology. In building and querying the database, we also developed a critical assessment and contextual analysis of MARGA\u2019s features. This afforded broader considerations on the construction, implementation and reuse of databases in bioarchaeology, evolutionary biology, and cognate disciplines. Results: Querying MARGA generated new insights into marginality in late prehistoric and early Roman Italy, which illuminated lifeways, human-environment interactions, and burial practices in the study areas. We summarize such knowledge advances in the article. In addition, MARGA provided a case study on opportunities and challenges in harnessing big data in bioarchaeology. We, therefore, identified constraints and directions for future research which, we anticipate, will shape developments in big-data initiatives. We drew inferences on issues concerning i) terminology in data categorization; ii) the impact of increasingly sophisticated analytical methods in bioarchaeology; iii) data reuse; and iv) ethics. As regards analytical methods, we provided three examples building on osteological, isotope and taphonomic data in MARGA. Conclusion: This study produced new knowledge on the lifeways of marginalized communities and the social meaning of inhumation, in different ecosystems of Italy c.1200 BC\u201325 AD. The study also showed that cutting-edge developments in bioarchaeology are multiplying and diversifying exponentially the data available for sampling and storage: this will impinge on the future evolution and fruition of databases. We determined that MARGA itself can be updated with the deposition of novel data for open research, and querying, which would bring these issues to the fore. Ultimately, we identified a dichotomy in the conceptualization of databases. If they are treated as finished products when published open access, they risk becoming obsolete as new data are produced. If, however, they are considered evolving projects constantly morphing and in flux, a ramification of complex issues arises around, for example, sustainability, access, ethics, technology, funding, and labour. MARGA, therefore, contributes towards conceptual groundworks in the wider big-data movement in bioarchaeology and cognate disciplines, while addressing limitations in evidence and methods.",

We particularly examine regulatory trends in granting MAR access to single women and lesbian couples in Europe, and how legislation aligns with attitudes towards single motherhood and same-sex parenthood. Utilizing descriptive analysis and two-level models on original MAR legislation data across 36 European countries and the European Values Study (2008\u201310 and 2017\u201320) for attitudes, we show that MAR access is granted to lesbian couples in contexts where same-sex parenthood is accepted. By contrast, legalized MAR access for single women seems rather disconnected from public opinion towards single motherhood. As a whole, the paper delineates contexts in which the combination of social acceptance and legal permissibility of MAR use for non-normative prospective parents may favor the formation of \u2018new\u2019 family forms.",

    "description": "Importance: Issues related to social connection are increasingly recognised as a global public health priority. However, there is a lack of a holistic understanding of social connection and its health impacts as most empirical research focuses on a single or few individual concepts of social connection. Objective: To explore patterns of social connection and their relationship with health and wellbeing outcomes. Design: Observational study using machine learning cluster analysis and regression analysis. Setting: England. Participants: Our analytical sample included 7,706 participants aged 50 or above from the forth wave of the English Longitudinal Study of Aging (2008-2009). Exposure: social connection clusters informed by the cluster analysis. Main Outcomes and Measures: This study considered a number of outcomes related to mental health (depression), hedonic (life satisfaction, pleasure) and eudaimonic (self-realisation) wellbeing, general health (self-reported health) and health behaviour (moderate or vigorous physical activity). We controlled for a number of key confounders identified using directed acyclic graphs, including age, sex, ethnicity, education, social class and wealth. Results: Among 7,706 participants, the mean age was 64.7 (SD=9.6) and 54.9% were females. We identified five clusters including: the highly connected (33.0%), disconnected (12.6%), gapped structure & poor function (14.4%), gapped structure & high function (20.5%) and poor function & mixed quality (19.5%) clusters. All clusters had poorer outcomes compared to the highly connected cluster. The difference was smallest between the highly connected and gapped structure & high function clusters across most outcomes.",

The primary motivation for this study is to shed light on the conceptual use and potential applicability of the path dependence framework in the field of collective memory research. Drawing on the scientific history of the dissemination and diffusion of the path dependence concept across disciplinary boundaries and academic debates, the paper underscores the importance of clarifying its theoretical underpinnings. It also examines the diffusion of the concept and the resulting diversification of its interpretations. Subsequently, the paper explores potential applications in the field of collective memory studies. Additionally, the paper raises critical questions concerning the possible challenges and implications associated with integrating the concept into memory research, particularly in relation to the phenomenon of 'conceptual stretching.'",

    "description": "This paper examines the 2022 Australian federal election coverage on WeChat for Australian audiences. We analyzed 3,462 public articles collected during May 2021 to May 2022 from 135 WeChat news services called WeChat Official Accounts (with 99 remaining active by the time of analysis). We found that diasporic Chinese media accounts had a more prominent role in shaping online discourses compared to China-based media accounts, Australia-based business accounts, or Australian politicians\u2019 accounts. In reporting the 2022 Australian federal election, COVID-19 policies, the economy, immigration, and international relations with particular regard to Australia-China relations, were common themes. Our findings reveal the formation of a \u201ctranslational news ecology\u201d that bridges diasporic media to Australia\u2019s English-speaking, mainstream public sphere which is primarily shaped by Australian national media and politicians.

We present results from a conjoint experimental study of a large-scale sample of the Japanese public, in which we estimate how much salary and benefits workers are willing to trade for best-in-practice harassment protections. We find that women are 6 percentage points more likely to prefer firms with anonymous, third-party harassment reporting systems compared to other firms, and they also negatively value workplaces with no sexual harassment reporting mechanism equivalently to a workplace with a 20% lower wage. Men also negatively value poor sexual harassment reporting mechanisms, but they are more willing to trade wages for better workplace bullying (\"power harassment\") reporting systems. These findings suggest that workers are willing to pay for harassment reporting systems, and that companies may better attract talent by adopting these reporting schemes.",

Analyzing current decarbonization strategies, their effectiveness, and the role of corporate commitment and risk management offers insights needed to identify development paths in the current environment characterized by pressure driven by stringent environmental standards and fierce competition. An empirical approach, including a survey model and simulation, is used to answer prominent research questions. Aspects such as the influence of environmental and governance criteria, specific initiatives that can be undertaken, the importance of corporate commitment, and the integration of risk management into strategic planning are examined. Simulations suggest that the probability of meeting the 2030 goals range from 65.08 to 75.98 percent and the delta between low and high commitment ranges from 4.917 to 4.133 percent according to the share of renewables in the energy mix decarbonization. The influence of the energy mix is also included in the analysis. The research highlights the need for greater coordination and commitment across the industry to improve decarbonization efforts. It emphasizes the critical role of government policies and market dynamics in shaping industry actions toward achieving decarbonization goals.

    "description": "This paper examines the role of the middle classes in processes of reinvestment in two neighborhoods in Santiago, Chile (\u00d1u\u00f1oa) and Buenos Aires, Argentina (San Telmo). These cities have inspired a significant gentrification literature. Yet, far from a uniform or inevitable process, the article suggests that regionally specific class meanings shape the residential choices of the middle-classes. Drawing on economic and cultural sociology, we show that housing choices are infused with status competitions that result in symbolic returns and shape the trajectory of neighborhoods. New high-rise development remains a potent symbol of middle-class status in these contexts, yet fewer residents are drawn to older housing markets or the former housing of the urban poor. The result is a highly contextual gentrification trajectory. Much of the residential and commercial development in \u00d1u\u00f1oa and San Telmo resulted from state policies rather than market dynamics. In both communities, to some degree, it was more common for middle class residents to be priced out rather than low-income residents being physically displaced to renovate housing for a local middle class. The two cases also offer evidence of middle-class collective action, with existing middle-class residents more likely to oppose development despite personal, material, and symbolic gains.",

    "description": "This study explores the evolutionary advantages of workplace gender equality using a simulation-based approach. Through an agent-based model, it contrasts the performance of societies adhering to two selection strategies: performance-based and equality-based, in scenarios with and without inherent sex disadvantages. The findings reveal that the equality approach, which ensures equal representation of sexes in job selections, accelerates societal performance evolution, outpacing the performance-only strategy even when sex-based disadvantages are factored in. This advantage is most pronounced in the early generations, highlighting the long-term benefits of gender equality policies in the workplace. The results underscore the importance of implementing gender equality measures in the workplace, not just as a matter of fairness but as a strategic advantage for societal advancement. This work suggests that policies enforcing workplace equality could offer unrecognized long-term benefits, urging a reevaluation of current approaches and encouraging further research to address its limitations and explore the broader implications of gender equality in evolving societies.",

    "description": "Background. A highly pathogenic strain of avian influenza (H5N1, or \u201cbird flu\u201d) began circulating across poultry farms worldwide in 2020. While the virus has been transmitted to mammals and humans in the past, media attention to the potential impact of H5N1 on human health following the documentation of unprecedented transmission between mammals in Spring 2024; including the prevalence of H5N1 in the commercial dairy supply. Objective. To quantify (a) the prevalence and (b) socio-political correlates (e.g., partisan identity, attitudes toward scientific expertise) of public concern about H5N1, as well as support for policy action aimed at reducing its potential risks to human health. Method. In a nationally representative longitudinal survey of N = 831 US adults, we asked respondents to answer a series of questions about the levels of concern about H5N1 transmission to humans, beliefs about the safety of consuming unpasteurized milk products, and support for government interventions aimed at reducing the public health risks posed by avian influenza outbreaks. Results. We find that a small minority of Americans express concern about the public health risks of H5N1, or reject misinformation about the safety of raw milk consumption. Low levels of concern and raw milk misinformation are in turn associated with opposition to policies aimed at reducing the public health risks borne by H5N1, as is both anti-intellectual attitude endorsement and partisan identification with the Republican Party. Conclusions. Public apathy about the public health risks borne by avian flu \u2013 and corresponding indifferences toward mitigating policy action \u2013 could undermine US pandemic preparedness. Lacking clear signals from the public to take action to address this important issue, policymakers may be reluctant to pursue policies that reduce avian influenza\u2019s pandemic potential.",

    "description": "There has been a major crackdown from the Hajj Administration this year (2024) on pilgrims performing the Hajj without a permit. The Hajj pilgrimage, one of the five pillars of the Islamic faith, continues to draw millions of devotees annually, despite the significant sacrifices, risks, and discomforts faced by those who journey without official permits. This paper delves into the underlying motives and compounded complexities driving pilgrims to undertake the Hajj without permit, examining factors such as spiritual obligation, economic barriers, and limited accessibility. By unraveling underpinning issues, the study sheds light on the shortcomings of the existing infrastructure and urban setup, which fuel the persistent demand for unauthorized Hajj participation. It emphasizes integrating past insights and present-day realities, to draw a holistic urban strategy to manage pilgrim influx sustainably while fostering economic opportunities. The proposed model advocates for interdisciplinary collaboration and community engagement to refine urban planning, preserve cultural heritage, and enhance the pilgrimage experience. Ultimately, this approach aims to ensure Makkah's continued role as a spiritual hub while addressing the evolving needs of pilgrims and residents alike.",

Oligopticons are networked devices and their supporting infrastructures that render the city in extremely narrow but very clear representations, in this case as a city of waste hotspots. In Rotterdam, public management is designing data-hungry oligopticons that map, control and intervene in the illegal disposal of waste and litter. An analysis of two vignettes from the author\u2019s ethnographic fieldwork finds that these oligopticons do more than simply make visible and control these practices of waste disposal: they instead engage in a punitive politics that frames those who illegally dispose of waste as exception to a normalizing way of life, fighting not waste but difference. Through ethnographic comparison, this paper aims to evoke thought, imagination and reflection in readers regarding the consequences of infrastructures of surveillance and control, and to the intimate knowledges that may escape these infrastructures.",

    "description": "The academic discipline of sociology is divided methodologically and theoretically, which has long been a source of consternation as well as celebration. In this paper we describe the state of actually existing sociology as practiced in PhD-granting departments, by analyzing all dissertation abstracts from U.S. sociology departments archived at ProQuest from 2020 through early 2024 (N=1872) using natural language processing methods (Keyword Assisted Topic Models with Latent Dirichelet Allocation). Results show that more dissertations (64%) use qualitative than quantitative (47%) methods. Where geographic scope is identified, most focus on U.S.topics. The most common substantive topics are inequality, broadly defined (58%), followed by economic subjects (46%), race (37%), politics and health (35% each). The most pervasive difference concerns qualitative versus quantitative approaches. For example, qualitative methods are most common in organizations and movements (79%), and least common in life course (43%) and children and youth studies (54%). Quantitative methods are most associated with life course (61%) and ethnicity (59%), and least common in social movements (34%). Finally, using gender probabilities based on given names, we find that average female representation is somewhat higher in qualitative studies (61%) than quantitative (56%) studies, but subject of study matters more, with the average probability of female authorship highest in gender (72%) and family (66%) studies, and lowest in urban studies (52%). Women are more concentrated in qualitative than quantitative studies across almost all subject areas, but the differences are relatively small, so that gender divisions appear to be driven more by subjects of study than by methodological approaches.

When the researcher seeking access is a criminology practitioner and that access is being sought from a criminal, the process of attempting to build trust and rapport, especially when the opportunity to engage presents itself by chance, is complicated. This ethnographic account outlines the process of such an encounter, balancing accountability to profession whilst simultaneously seeking to operationalise the theoretical intertwining of the criminology practitioner and independent academic researcher status. The duality of these seemingly opposite roles of this specific encounter is contrasted by the creative opportunity of cultural criminology\u2019s methodological approach of verstehen. Techniques of impression management to elicit a favourable response were fluid and evolving, recognising when one approach was failing and changing direction to pursue another. This approach needed to coexist and compliment the disposal of the criminological encounter from a practitioner control agent perspective. This was achieved by the use of discretion. Limited success was gained post interaction with a potential channel of communication elicited by a third party for possible access to the field, although there is no certainty of this.",

    "description": "This essay provides an answer to the question ``What is digitalization policy?'', through the lens of policy integration. To do so, I introduce a core distinction between naive and encompassing understandings of digitalization policy. Then, I posit that digitalization policy does not have a singular policy domain but rather distributed impacts across different policy domains. Digitalization policy is therefore always policy integration. Combining this assertion with an encompassing understanding of digitalization policy, I arrive at a modern definition of digitalization policy as any policy that targets the direct regulation of digital communication and digital infrastructure, in conjunction with the impact of such regulation on any affected policy domain(s). From this perspective, I argue that drivers of digitalization policy can be found in established groups of drivers of policy integration, based on institutions, interests or ideas. The essay suggests a blueprint for constructively approaching research on policy related to digitalization. It concludes with an illustrative application of the blueprint to an empirical example of a digitalization policymaking process in Switzerland, a policy sprint on the contribution of artificial intelligence to sustainability.",

We expand on this research by examining the economic arguments deployed by both opponents and proponents of climate mitigation in the debates over the Kyoto Protocol from 1997-2001. Through an analysis of 790 articles in three national newspapers alongside key documents, we find that the dominant economic framing contrasted competing claims about the cost of mitigation (whether it would have a large or small impact on the American economy). In contrast, virtually no actors - including proponents - argued that Kyoto would provide substantial benefits to the US in terms of reduced climate impacts, in part because prominent economic models ignored those impacts or assumed them to be small. This analysis suggests that mainstream economic expertise may have contributed to the failure of the United States to implement substantial climate policy.",

Such manuscripts were identified based on their content, as they include expositions of the Creed, the Lord\u2019s Prayer and the mass, baptismal instructions, and descriptions of clerical grades. This article shows that the presence of material from books VI-VIII of the Etymologiae of Isidore of Seville, in particular De officiis (Etym. VI 19) and De clericis (Etym. VII 12), also characterizes Carolingian manuscripts for priests. It identifies four well-attested Carolingian catechetic collections assembled from excerpts from Isidore\u2019s works to serve as instructional manuals for priests. These collections originated in northern France in the last decades of the eighth or the first decades of the ninth century and appear connected to Carolingian correctio. The paper also identifies other Isidorean catechetic collections surviving in a single manuscript and excerpt collections whose intended use by priests cannot be fully substantiated. These compilations of Isidorean excerpts attest to a shift in the perception of the Etymologiae under the influence of the reforms, namely its reinvention as a didactic resource, despite Isidore\u2019s intended use of the text as an encyclopaedia.",

    "link": "https://share.osf.io/preprint/E0103-9B6-400",
    "description": "The Etymologiae of Isidore of Seville was one of the most widely read works of the early Middle Ages, as is evidenced by the number of surviving manuscripts. August Eduard Anspach\u2019s handlist from the 1940s puts their number at almost 1,200, of which approximately 300 were estimated to have been copied before the year 1000. This article, based on a new manuscript survey of the early medieval manuscripts transmitting the Etymologiae, brings the number of known surviving pre-1000 manuscripts transmitting the Etymologiae to almost 450. Of these, 84 well-preserved codices and 24 fragments contain the canonical Etymologiae, i.e., they reflect the integral transmission of Isidore\u2019s work as an encyclopedia, while 300 well-preserved codices and 21 fragments reflect the selective or non-canonical transmission of the Etymologiae, principally not as an encyclopedia. Due to the uneven survival rates of manuscripts of canonical and non-canonical Etymologiae, it seems likely that the latter accounted for perhaps as much as 80-90% of manuscripts transmitting Isidore\u2019s work before the year 1000. Four non-canonical formats emerge as having been particularly influential in the early Middle Ages: the separate transmission of the first book of the Etymologiae as an ars grammatica; the compilation of various catechetical collections, sometimes in question-and-answer form, from books VI, VII, and VIII of the Etymologiae; the incorporation of material from books V and IX into law collections; and the incorporation of segments from books III, V, VI, and XIII into computistic manuals. The surviving manuscripts suggest that the latter format emerged in the insular world, while the others are more distinctly Carolingian. Northern France and northern Italy emerge as the two most important regional hubs of the copying of the Etymologiae in the ninth and tenth centuries. While in the former region, non-canonical formats seem to have been the most important vehicle of the transmission of material from Isidore\u2019s work, in the latter, the canonical format may have been more influential, indicating that there existed regional differences in the reception of the Etymologiae.",

    "description": "Besides glosses and other textual annotations, early medieval Latin manuscript commonly feature technical signs, annotation symbols and sigla that reflect readership or provide a framework for interpretation and use. The early medieval Insular book users were particularly keen on using such devices. This article maps the usage of technical signs in a corpus of early medieval Irish manuscripts produced on the Continent or preserved and used there early after the production. In the center of the inquiry are four manuscripts belonging to an Irish scholarly circle associated with Sedulius Scottus. The article concludes that: * Insular, and specifically Irish, annotators used a specific repertoire of technical signs; * This Insular/Irish repertoire is substantially distinct from the repertoire of technical signs used by Carolingian scribes and therefore allows for discerning books annotated by Insular/Irish users on the Continent; * A noticeable difference exists between various identifiable clusters of manuscripts annotated by Insular/Irish users, suggesting that different annotators and circles drew on different parts of the Insular repertoire; * The manuscripts from the Sedulius group stand out from among other Irish books produced on the Continent on account of the specific mode of annotation, which seems to have been particular to the circle of scholars that produced them; * The Greek Psalter of Sedulius, which contains the subscription of Sedulius Scottus, displays a pattern of sign use distinct from the one found in the manuscripts from the Sedulius group and therefore does not seem related to them; * One or two lightly-annotated manuscripts contain traces of annotation in the manner of the Sedulius circle and therefore may reflect activities of the scholars from this scholarly group.",

    "description": "In recent decades, sustainability has emerged as a central theme in addressing future uncertainties, intertwined with discourses on ecology, conservation, resilience and socio-ecological justice. While much scholarly attention has focused on sustainability in industrial production, design, global development and lifestyles, the relationship between sustainability and basic research remains underexplored. This paper addresses this gap by examining how sustainability concerns are integrated into scientific practice, specifically within basic research in science and engineering. Through a collaborative ethnographic research process within an interdisciplinary initiative at the University of Technology Dresden, we explore how sustainability and basic research can inform one another. Our analysis draws on qualitative methods, including interviews and group discussions and is grounded in perspectives from sociology, anthropology and Science and Technology Studies (STS), particularly valuation studies. We investigate the various meanings of sustainability as invoked in the appraisal and evaluation of basic research, pursuing the question: What is valued when basic research is deemed \u2018sustainable\u2019? Our findings are organized around four central themes: sustainability as efficiency, sustainability through flexibility, sustainability assessment as estimation and sustainability assessment as finding leverage. These themes reveal the complexities and challenges of appraising basic research in terms of sustainability.",

    "description": "We take the case of desired residential mobility during the pandemic with the intent of going beyond understanding the pandemic as disruption, framing it instead as creative destruction. By revisiting Joseph Schumpeter\u2019s classic thesis, we transpose its economic into a social vocabulary of new \u2018lifeforms\u2019, \u2018mutations\u2019 and \u2018wants\u2019 that innovative agents\u2013movers, in our case\u2013enact in their quest for the \u2018good life\u2019/\u2018good home\u2019. Drawing on 77 qualitative questionnaires, we examine how urban-to-rural and urban-to-urban movers negotiated the pull-and-push factors of relocation, and to what extent changing house fits a model of lifestyle change. Proposing the metaphor of \u2018privileged mutations\u2019, we cast urban-to-rural moves as lasting and thorough creative destructions: old housing wants are rendered obsolete and \u2018revolutionary\u2019 new ones are being created, a process which may set in motion a second creative destruction, that of place. However, the landscape of residential mobility during the pandemic also comprises quiet transformations driven by a quest for home comfort that those relatively privileged have always pursued along life-course while remaining attached to the buzz of urban life. Observing the rich potential and underuse of the Schumpeterian perspective in social sciences, we invite scholars to consider its explanatory power in future research.",

    "description": "Conventional wisdom surrounding President Joe Biden\u2019s unprecedented decision to exit the 2024 Presidential race suggests that he came to view his would-be nomination as detrimental for the Democratic Party; both with respect to turnout, as well as the success of \u201cdown-ballot\u201d candidates for federal and state-wide office. Whether or not conventional wisdom is correct, however, remains an open question. The answer to this question can help shed light on whether or not the president\u2019s electoral calculus, and the calculi of those who may one day find themselves in a similar position, is likely to be effective. We answer this question by studying a naturally occurring experiment surrounding the President\u2019s decision to exit the race; a period in which we happened to be fielding the second wave (NWave 2 = 831) of a nationally representative two-wave panel study (NWave 1 = 1,400), with invitation assignment randomly assigned (from the original response pool) throughout Wave 2 survey administration. Pre-registered difference-in-difference (DID) analyses reveal no evidence of significant turnout or down-ballot effects across either the US adult population or partisan subgroups. However, post hoc tests reveal substantial gains in excitement about the 2024 campaign across both the general population and (especially) among self-identified Democrats. We conclude by discussing the lessons learned from the one-of-a-kind dataset, and potential limitations of this research.",

    "description": "Critical scholars have long called for state recognition of de facto families, beyond legal or biological ties, as a pathway towards inclusion of more diverse family forms. This article asks to which extent recognition of de facto families indeed leads to more inclusion, in the context of a restrictive immigration regime where families need state permission to live together. It zooms in on migration law practice in the Netherlands, through an analysis of laws and regulations, work instructions of street level implementers, and interviews with migration lawyers. It finds that conceptions of family-as-doing which focus on practices of dependency and care play a small but significant role in Dutch migration law, enabling inclusion of families beyond the nuclear model. However, recognition of de facto families may lead to new forms of state scrutiny of intimate lives, as well as to new forms of exclusion.",

This paper reports on the results of implementing our diagnostic multiple-choice assessments in a College Algebra course over a three year span. Quantitative and qualitative analysis suggests these assessments associate student knowledge with their choices and thus can be used as practical diagnostic tools.

    "description": "Sociologists are often interested in estimating and testing whether some causal effect varies by a modifier of interest. The conventional regression estimator for effect modification is inflexible in functional form and prone to misspecification bias. Machine Learning (ML) algorithms can aid the estimation of effect modification in observational studies by controlling for confounders in a highly flexible, automated, yet principled way. Therefore, leveraging ML for effect modification helps reduce misspecification bias and enhance the credibility of causal identification. We introduce a novel estimator that estimates effect modification in a familiar regression framework after using ML algorithms to fit nuisance components of the model. We show that this estimator is more flexible than the conventional regression model while more efficient and suitable for theory-driven sociological research than other ML-based methods. We use the new estimator to study the modification in the effect of a college degree on adult family income by gender and family income in adolescence in the United States. Along these two dimensions, the benefits of a college degree are rather equally distributed.",

    "description": "In general, support for gender equality and LGBTIQ+ has increased in the past decades. Cur-rent studies suggest a broad overall endorsement. However, gender-related issues have become increasingly politicized and publicly contested in recent years. Especially the political and media debate has intensified and right-wing populist and radical right parties campaign against a so-called \u201cgenderism\u201d. Against this backdrop, a common perception is that all kinds of is-sues revolving around gender conflate into a single, overarching discourse about gender and sexuality that is antagonistically polarized between a supportive and a dismissive camp. What remains unclear is whether this form of discursive polarization on gender-related issues reso-nates with public opinion. Based on data from the German Social Cohesion Panel from 2022, we can show that there is a need to differentiate the debate and conceptually separate two distinct dimensions of gender issues: while binary issues, i.e. issues that concern equality be-tween men and women, receive overwhelming support from the German population, non-heteronormative issues, i.e. issues that concern LGBTIQ+, are viewed with great skepticism. Accordingly, due to the high support of binary gender issues, there hardly seems to be any room for political mobilization on them. This is completely different with regard to non-heteronormative issues. Right-wing populist parties like the German AfD stand out in attract-ing voters who oppose the promotion of equality for gender and sexual minorities.",

The data consist of qualitative online survey responses from 1011 runners and were analyzed via abductive content analysis. As a result, we identified three dispositional frames (running for training, health and recreation, and sociality) and three technological frames (technology as verificator, motivator, and safeguard), the combinations of which highlight the often multifaceted, layered, and situational relationship people have with recreational running and technology use.",

Limited research on interventions in media reporting of gambling harm complicates the development of best practices for reporting guidelines. This scoping review explored research on media guidelines for stigmatised conditions, including substance use, mental ill health, suicidality, and poverty. Databases searched included PubMed, Scopus, and Web of Science, alongside grey literature from Google and targeted organisation websites. Two reviewers screened titles, abstracts, and full texts, with extracted data analysed descriptively.

Effective implementation requires training, stakeholder collaboration, and continuous feedback, while challenges include balancing journalistic freedom with ethical considerations and contextual adaptation. The review identified essential elements in current news media guidelines for the selected conditions, highlighting that collaboration among media professionals, public health practitioners, and lived experience communities is crucial.

    "description": "While research emphasized the risk of gendered sample selection bias among the elderly decades ago, the empirical literature on old-age inequalities remains largely unaware of it. This research note addresses this issue by investigating gendered sample selectivity for individuals aged 65 or older employing two common sample criteria: self-reported retirement status and pension receipt in countries covered by the Survey of Health, Ageing, and Retirement in Europe (SHARE). Findings show that more than half of older women are excluded when these criteria are applied. Gender selection bias varies widely across countries and is less pronounced in post-socialist or social-democratic welfare states. Visualizing work trajectories by sample status reveals that women with long unpaid care work periods and men with high self-employment, unemployment, and extended education levels are particularly likely to be excluded. Studies employing such sample criteria risk underestimating gender inequalities in pensions, health, and life satisfaction. The implications are severe for Southern, conservative, and liberal welfare states, and for cross-country comparisons, where sample bias often goes undetected due to its variability across contexts. While this article cannot offer a universal recommendation for sample definitions, it aims to promote less biased sample conceptualizations in studies of the elderly population.",

These two leading authors\u2019 conflicting views are clearly documented in four chapters in Hon and Rakover\u2019s 2001 book: \u201cExplanation: Theoretical approaches and applications\u201d. After a detailed analysis of the differences between Lipton\u2019s and Salmon\u2019s views, three rival potential explanations of Lipton\u2019s and Salmon\u2019s differences\u2014from three different scholars, one being Lipton\u2014are also discussed. Then, based on an empirical test, the explanation advocated in this paper\u2014which is inspired by Thaler\u2019s work on behavioral economics\u2014is selected as best. That explanation is that Lipton\u2019s arguments in favour of IBE provide a strong behavioral explanation of how human beings (Humans) actually draw inferences, whereas Salmon\u2019s views provide a rational normative Bayesian position on how non-demonstrative inferences should be made (by Rational Analysts, or RatAns for short). It is suggested that the cause of the difference in decision making processes used by Humans (compared to RatAns) is that Human inference making processes are the result of millions of years of evolution of our brains, and are therefore probably different to, and less reliable than, rational expert analysis of the probabilities involved, as found in Bayesianism.",

People moving to regional cities and towns favour being close to the coast and having easy access to larger cities while also having a warmer and wetter climate. New AHURI research examines the place-based factors (i.e. that may be specific to a place) that influence people moving to and from Australian regional areas and considers policy solutions for managing the impacts of these changes. Growth is positively related to connectivity, such as by being close to major railways, roads, airports and larger cities and employment centres. Internet connection speeds may also be a factor in migration to certain non-metropolitan areas, with technological advancements and favourable economic conditions enabling former city dwellers to telecommute from smaller regional locations. Access to hospitals and available health infrastructure can be significant considerations for people considering moving to a regional city. A key challenge in regional areas is that for vacancies in key employment sectors, local residents may not have requisite skills and attracting key workers from city locations can be challenging as housing challenges, reduced services (i.e. childcare) and other factors of liveability, and lack of job opportunities for a spouse, can be a disincentive.

    "description": "Field education is a significant component of social work education and might be the signature pedagogy. Yet current issues limit the quality of experience that students can receive from practicum. These issues include austerity policies, exhaustion of altruism, trends towards clinical social work and privatized human services, and a lack of student readiness. Degree granting institutions, such as universities, have long relied on altruism to run social work field education programs but austerity measures may mean that historical altruism can no longer be relied upon. The lack of compensation for practicum students and field instructors is unethical and may contribute to conflicts of interest and exploitation in practicum. This article details these present challenges in social work field education through incorporating scholarship and reflection and presents ideas for change. Enhanced orientation and stipends for practicum students and field instructors have shown preliminary promise in mitigating modern social work field education difficulties. For field education to be social work\u2019s signature pedagogy, practicum planning and associated policies must be treated with respect and rigour, constantly scrutinized and improved upon as the field develops and changes.",

    "description": "Das Ziel der vorliegenden Studie ist es, abweichendes Verhalten in der COVID-19 Pandemie zu erkl\u00e4ren und empirisch zu erforschen. Genauer liegt der Fokus auf Determinanten von Impfnachweisf\u00e4lschungen und des L\u00fcgens in Bezug auf den eigenen Impf- und Teststatus. Es werden Daten einer Online-Befragung ausgewertet (n = 549). Mit Blick auf die Erkl\u00e4rung des abweichenden Verhaltens, k\u00f6nnen die aus der Rational Choice Theory abgeleiteten Hypothesen zur Sanktionswahrscheinlichkeit und Sanktionsh\u00f6he empirisch nicht best\u00e4tigt werden. Die Hypothesen zum Einfluss von sozialen Normen sind dagegen robuster. So ist das abweichende Verhalten im eigenen sozialen Umfeld ein guter Pr\u00e4diktor f\u00fcr die eigene Impfnachweisf\u00e4lschung. Zudem verh\u00e4lt sich eine Person eher dann abweichend, wenn sie glaubt, dass sich die Mehrheit der Gesellschaft nicht an Corona-Restriktionen h\u00e4lt. Schlie\u00dflich zeigt die \u00dcberpr\u00fcfung einer Reihe von Einstellungshypothesen, dass das Misstrauen in das Robert Koch-Institut ein robuster Pr\u00e4diktor f\u00fcr die eigene Devianz ist.",

    "description": "Blair et al. (2023) examine the effect of UN peacekeeping on democratization in conflict-affected countries. They use fixed effects and instrumental variable estimators and find evidence that \u201dUN missions with democracy promotion mandates are strongly positively correlated with the quality of democracy in host countries but that the magnitude of the relationship is larger for civilian than for uniformed personnel, stronger when peacekeepers engage rather than bypass host governments when implementing reforms, driven in particular by UN election administration and oversight, and more robust during periods of peace than during periods of civil war\u201d. Since the authors provide an impressive list of robustness checks, we focus on computational and robustness reproducibility. We replicate the findings using the Stata code provided in the replication material and reproduce all main analyses in R. We add year fixed effects to country fixed effects, cluster standard errors, use fixed and random panel regression estimators and ordered Beta regression estimators. We furthermore reproduce instrumental variable estimators with two different packages. We find that the original findings were reproducible and robust.",

    "description": "Building on findings in diverse literatures in political science, economics and psychology, we surmise that an important effect of the steep rise in inequality in the United States may be to undermine popular support for public investment in costly collective goods. We argue that economic inequality may influence perceptions of the: fairness of the political economy system in the broad sense; fairness of the distributive features of a policy on either the tax or spend side; and likelihood of successful delivery of promised policy goals. Via any of these mechanisms, citizens who learn or attend to the fact that they are on the losing side of rising inequality might be expected to become less willing to pay material costs to pay for collective goods. We evaluate the impact of inequality on collective goods support, finding support for our theory in a series of experimental studies",

    "description": "Climatic variability and change disrupt environmental and socioeconomic systems, with widespread implications for human health and wellbeing. A growing demographic literature examines the relationship between climate variability and children\u2019s health and nutritional security in low- and middle-income countries. These impacts may operate through multiple biological and socioeconomic pathways, which provide a strong conceptual basis for expecting climate effects but make the formation of directional hypotheses difficult. These issues are amplified by the potential influence of several selection biases, including from climate-induced mortality. We contribute to this literature by measuring the effects of temperature and precipitation variability on the weight and height of 0-23 month-old (n=362,352) and 24-59 month-old (n=532,497) children, respectively, across 57 developing countries. We measure overall temperature and precipitation effects across the sample and by world region, and test for differences in effects within regions by sex, birth order, mother\u2019s education, and rural (urban) residence. We supplement our analysis of nutrition by fitting models of child mortality, which is an important outcome and a potential source of bias in our health models. We find that recent temperature anomalies are negatively associated with children\u2019s weight-for-height (WHZ) in most regions of the world but early-childhood temperature exposures are positively associated with height-for-age (HAZ). These effects vary only modestly between and within regions, although the lack of overall climate effects on health in Latin America and the Caribbean is notable. Importantly, our models of childhood mortality show that heat exposures are positively associated with mortality risk at all ages and may be especially strong among children ages 24-59 months. These results suggest that estimated climate effects on WHZ and HAZ may be upwardly biased and imply that the apparently positive effects of temperature on HAZ may be in part an artifact of selective mortality.",

    "description": "Scholars have paid minimal attention to the political and practical objectives that guided Tuskegee Institute\u2019s sociological program and institutional interventions in the 19th and 20th centuries. Leveraging a multi-modal, historical sociological approach grounded in primary and secondary analyses of biographical data, narratives, and archival data, I show that Tuskegee\u2019s institutional interventions illustrate three abolitionist tactics: (1) building consciousness through research dissemination and place-based investment, (2) galvanizing Southern whites and political elites to abolish lynching locally, and (3) countering the propaganda used to justify lynching to inspire divestment from lynching and carceral punishment. Booker T. Washington\u2019s commitment to eradicating structural racism and resource deprivation in the aftermath of slavery led to Tuskegee Institute\u2019s formation of the first department of applied rural sociology in the United States, and the Negro Farmers\u2019 conference and Movable School interventions supported a comprehensive anti-poverty strategy. Likewise, the research activism of Monroe Work disseminated via the Negro Year Book and individual publications sought to galvanize the abolition of lynching and carceral punishment. In the wake of re-emerged visibility of white supremacist terrorism and commitments to practicing Du Boisian sociology across the United States, I argue that reviving the memory of Tuskegee\u2019s institutional practices makes a case for reconsidering the place of abolition in academic sociology in the 21st century.",

Second, we adapt and apply an integrative dual systems model of self-regulation as a framework for organising and evaluating the design features found. Our analysis aims to help the design of better tools in two ways: (i) by identifying how, through a well-established model of self-regulation, current tools overlap and differ in how they support self-control; and (ii) by using the model to reveal underexplored cognitive mechanisms that could aid the design of new tools.",

The effects are more pronounced where rural credit is more abundant, property rights are stronger, and gender norms are more unequal. Our findings highlight the unintended consequences of the spread of new technologies on rural asset ownership, underscoring the importance of considering gender disparities in crafting agricultural and climate change strategies.",

    "description": "Objective: To examine young adult women\u2019s and men\u2019s time use for routine housework when moving out of the parental household. Background: From a life-course perspective, establishing an own household is one of the key markers of the transition to adulthood. Leaving home is associated with new responsibilities concerning the organization of everyday life, including housework, and provides a new context for \u201cdoing gender\u201d. Methods: Hours for routine housework were estimated with longitudinal fixed effects regression models, using data from the German Socio-Economic Panel Study (1991\u20132020) on 911 women and 721 men, aged 18\u201332, who moved to an own couple or non-couple household. Results: During the transition to an own household, young adult women increased their time for routine housework by 18 minutes. Young adult men\u2019s increases were larger with 21 minutes. However, the gender gap in routine housework hours widened when young adults moved into couple households but showed a converging pattern when they moved into non-couple households. Conclusion: Women continue to do more housework than men in early adulthood, although moving into non-couple settings tends to decrease gender inequality on average.",

    "description": "Numerous studies into nonviolent resistance have led to a broad but scattered understanding of why some of these movements erupt and succeed, while others do not. This article offers a multilevel framework of analysis to explain trajectories of nonviolent resistance in repressive regimes and illustrates this framework by analysing the potential of Russian domestic nonviolent resistance to the full-scale invasion of Ukraine. The proposed framework incorporates seven overarching factors identified in previous studies, namely the political and economic system, the international relations, the level of modernization, the distribution of power within society, and the grievances, resources and organizational capacity of the resistance group. Based on this framework, it is tentatively concluded that Russia\u2019s political and economic system, the limited power dispersion and the lack of organization among the opposition help to explain why no successful resistance has emerged. Additional case studies are required to further assess the framework\u2019s utility.",

When asked about \u201cmen\u201d and &#8220;women&#8221; in general, respondents may imagine women (men) with lower (higher) labor market resources. Therefore, standard measures may conflate gender ideologies (injunctive norms) with stereotypical beliefs (descriptive norms). We test this hypothesis with an experiment in the German family panel pairfam: \u223c1,200 respondents rated the appropriate division of housework in \u223c3,700 hypothetical couples. By gradually adding information about labor market resources, we were able to override respondents&#8217; stereotypical beliefs.

The main difference between &#8220;traditional&#8221; and &#8220;egalitarian&#8221; respondents is not in their ideologies (as previously thought), but in their interpretation of vague items.

Second, we measured change in general attitudes toward Asians by comparing the control group responses in 2020 and 2022. The results demonstrate that, over the same period, general attitudes toward Asians have not improved despite growing attention toward anti-Asian biases.

It demonstrates that the adoption of PRM tools reduced maltreatment confirmations among Hispanic and Black children but increased such confirmations among high-risk and low-SES children. PRM tools did not reduce the likelihood of subsequent maltreatment confirmations; and effects were heterogeneous across counties. These findings demonstrate that the use of PRM tools can reduce the incidence of state interventions among historically over-represented minorities while increasing it among poor children more generally. However, they also illustrate that the impact of such tools depends on local contexts and that technological innovations do not meaningfully address chronic state interventions in family life that often characterize the lives of vulnerable children.",

Relying on a large data set that includes more than 10,000 player\u2013years, we show that accounting for better-justified performance measures reduces but does not nullify the effects of status cumulative advantage on All-Star selections. However, when replacing All-Star selections with a less ambiguous measure (selections to All-NBA teams), we no longer find evidence of decoupling between player performance and award nomination. From this we conclude that cumulative status advantage only affects selection when voters view factors other than statistical performance as legitimate, perhaps even desired, selection criteria.

    "link": "https://sociologicalscience.com/articles-v11-24-649/",
    "description": "We investigate how unemployment insurance generosity impacts reemployment and economic precarity by family type. With Swiss longitudinal administrative data and a regression discontinuity design using potential benefit duration, we examine differences between single households and primary and secondary or equal earners, as well as differences by gender and presence of children. Less generous unemployment insurance (shorter potential benefit duration) speeds up reemployment for all family types during the period with benefit cuts whereas longer-term effects are stronger for single households, secondary and equal earners, and those without children. Economic precarity increases for singles, single-parents, and primary earners during the period with lower benefits though there are no long-term effects. We argue that those with higher financial responsibility (i.e., primary earners or those with children) face pressure to find jobs irrespective of benefit generosity whereas those with lower financial responsibility (i.e., secondary or equal earners and those without children) have more capacity to react.",

    "title": "Disparate Impact? Career Disruptions and COVID-19 Impact Statements in Tenure Evaluations",
    "link": "https://sociologicalscience.com/articles-v11-23-626/",
    "description": "Extensive research reveals employer biases against workers with career disruptions, particularly those related to caregiving. However, the effectiveness of organizational practices intended to mitigate such biases is less well understood. This study examines the use of COVID-19 impact statements in tenure decisions at research universities, an organizational intervention that was designed to reduce biases but raised concerns that it might inadvertently amplify them. Contrary to concerns about unintended consequences, a pre-registered survey experiment with 602 full professors in STEM fields reveals that the inclusion of impact statements leads to more favorable tenure evaluations, regardless of faculty gender and disruption type. Qualitative evidence suggests that perceptions of pandemic-related disruptions as legitimate, externally imposed, time-limited events in the past help circumvent previously documented biases. This study enhances our understanding of organizational practices that effectively mitigate biases and points to the potential role of narrative framing in workplace evaluations and organizational inequalities.",

    "link": "https://sociologicalscience.com/articles-v11-21-579/",
    "description": "Does (under-)performance of athletes from stigmatized racial groups influence the incidence of racial hate crimes? We consider the case of the English national football team during the 2020 European Football Championship and analyze whether the performance of black players during the final at Wembley affected the number of racial hate crimes committed in London. The three English players who missed their penalties in the final are all black English players. Combining insights from (displaced) frustration-aggression and scapegoat theory, we argue that the frustration of losing the final resulted in violence directed at racial minority group members in London. Our findings show that the lost final triggered a 30 percent increase in racial hate crimes in the weeks following the event. The immediate impact was larger in boroughs with higher pre-event levels of racial hate crimes, indicating a galvanizing instead of a mobilizing exacerbation of this trigger event.",

    "link": "https://sociologicalscience.com/articles-v11-20-553/",
    "description": "The changes in daily life induced by the COVID-19 pandemic brought renewed attention to longstanding concerns about social isolation in the United States. Despite the links between the physical setting for individuals&#8217; daily lives and their connections with family, friends, and the various institutions of collective life, trends in where American adults spend their time have been largely overlooked as researchers have focused on how and with whom they spend their time. This article analyzes data from the American Time Use Survey over a timeframe spanning nineteen years and argues that the changes in Americans&#8217; daily routines induced by the COVID era should be seen as an acceleration of a longer-term trend: the rise of time spent at home. Results show that from 2003 to 2022, average time spent at home among American adults has risen by one hour and 39 minutes in a typical day. Time at home has risen for every subset of the population and for virtually all activities. Preliminary analysis indicates that time at home is associated with lower levels of happiness and less meaning, suggesting the need for enhanced empirical attention to this major shift in the setting of American life.",

    "link": "https://sociologicalscience.com/articles-v11-30-815/",
    "description": "How does prosocial behavior extend beyond in-group boundaries in multiethnic societies? The differentiation of Western societies presents an opportunity to understand the tension between societal pressures that push people outside the comfort zones of their familiar networks to constructively interact with unknown diverse others and the tendency toward homophily and in-group favoritism. We introduce a three-step model of out-group exposure that includes macrostructural conditions for intergroup encounters and microlevel dynamics of intergroup selection and interaction. Using lab-in-the-field experiments with a large representative sample of Italian natives and immigrants from the multiethnic city of Milan, we find that, when pushed to interact with non-coethnics, Italians generally treat them similarly to how they treat coethnics and value signs of social and market integration. However, when given the opportunity to select their interaction partners, Italians favor coethnics over immigrants. Taken together, these results help reconcile classical findings concerning the positive effects of intergroup contact with evidence documenting the persistence of out-group discrimination in selection processes.",

    "description": "Social media are frequently blamed for exacerbating ideological divides. We evaluate whether it is possible to design a social media platform that instead promotes productive, open-minded dialogue among users. We recruited 1,043 Americans who expressed willingness to test a new social media platform by installing a mobile app we developed for iOS and Android devices. Participants were randomly assigned to spend ten minutes on one of two versions of a simulated social media platform. The first was a control condition designed to resemble typical text-based social media sites, and users were told that people whose posts are liked very often receive a \u201cpopular user\u201d badge. The second version was identical to the first, but respondents were instead told users receive an \u201copen-minded\u201d badge if they respectfully engage with opposing viewpoints. Participants using both versions were asked to join an ongoing discussion about either gun control or immigration. Unbeknownst to them, each participant only interacted with chatbots powered by generative AI. We find that respondents assigned to the experimental condition exhibited more intellectually humble language in their posts and comments and reported experiencing more positive emotions. We do not find significant treatment effects on participants\u2019 self-reported intellectual humility, affective polarization, or issue attitudes. These results have important implications for future research on social media and social psychology and introduce new methods for conducting randomized controlled trials using generative artificial intelligence.",

    "description": "This chapter examines the different channels operated by and for people with disabilities and how the participation of disabled citizen journalists contributes to the social construction of disability. Citizen journalists create several disability news websites, blogs, podcasts, YouTube channels, and other media forms every year, reaching a large and expanding audience. Further, many of these outlets can and do have an impact beyond the disability community, influencing legacy media and non-disabled audiences. The chapter will discuss historical events (e.g., the independent living movement, the introduction of closed captioning), as well as trade organizations focused on disability rights (e.g., the National Center on Disability and Journalism).",

    "description": "This paper explores the opportunities and challenges that the promotion of European integration among Galician youth currently faces. We first examine the obstacles that the region faces, which revolve around a lack of awareness, representation and pro-European civil society organizations, a limited knowledge of the English language and geographical isolation. However, Galicia is a region that enjoys unique opportunities, which we then explore, such as a lack of Euroscepticism, strong cultural ties with other European regions, the Cami\u00f1o de Santiago, the region's key role in the maritime and artificial intelligence sectors, and low third-level education costs. We conclude by proposing a series of recommendations to better equip the region of Galicia with the tools and resources needed to promote Europeanism among young people. Through our recommendations, we aim to foster a sense of European identity and solidarity among young people in Galicia, which is essential for the further integration of Galicia into the European Union.",

    "link": "https://share.osf.io/preprint/E00AE-8FC-77E",
    "description": "This article argues that process models of criminal decision-making require not only data capturing the inputs (person and setting characteristics) and outputs of a decision process (intention/action), but also data pertaining to the decision process itself. It further proposes a rigorous methodological framework, referred to as the virtual reality process tracing approach (VRPTA), which allows researchers to test predictions not only about what decisions people make but also about how they make them. It brings together the process tracing methodology used in the cognitive, social and behavioural sciences and combines it with experimental VR scenarios used in criminology. The result is a versatile methodological framework that utilises real-time decision-making by study participants immersed in experimentally manipulated VR environments, along with process tracing techniques that allow researchers to open the black box of decision-making. To make the contribution as tangible as possible, this article discusses the novel methodological approach by reference to its application in the context of Situational Action Theory\u2019s (SAT) perception choice process (PCP). With some modification it may also be used for a range of other process-oriented theories in criminology and beyond.",

    "description": "There are many instances wherein people are discredited and stigmatized because of what they see as being factual, true, or scientific. This paper analyzes how knowledge and fact claims are tied to stigmatization. More specifically, this paper examines how stigmatizers use fact claims to dehumanize and exclude others. The data for this paper is drawn from an online ethnography of two online communities, one for involuntarily celibate (or \u201cincel\u201d) men (incels.is), and the other focused on far-right politics and White supremacy (4chan.org/pol/). Using Link and Phelan\u2019s (2014) Stigma Power framework, I demonstrate how members of these communities use knowledge and fact claims to keep people down (degrade and dehumanize others), keep people in (police in-group members and enforce norms), and keep people away (exclude others and mark them as dangerous). I argue that keeping people down, in, and away work \u2018hand in glove\u2019 to discredit and distance others based on fact claims. The paper aims to combine social psychological and science studies perspectives on stigma, while also demonstrating how the stigmatization of knowledge and fact claims can advance polarization and radicalization.",

    "link": "https://share.osf.io/preprint/E0022-B70-CCA",
    "description": "Understanding the parental leave system at childbearing age is crucial for life after childbirth, regardless of gender. According to a 2021 UNICEF report, Japan has the best paid paternity leave policy in the world. However, the uptake rate of parental leave for Japanese male employees remains low compared to international averages. Many Japanese fathers may be underutilizing this benefit of this highly ranked parental leave system. Although there are several reasons for this, this study focuses on a lack of understanding of the particulars parental leave system. The empirical results of this study show that female employees possess more knowledge than their male counterparts and that the determinants of this knowledge differ between men and women. A worrying aspect of these results is the lack of opportunities for young male employees to improve their parental leave knowledge in the \u201clowest-low fertility\u201d society of Japan. Future research is needed to try to identify new determinants of this knowledge to better understand and overcome the relationship of this problem to Japan\u2019s low fertility rate.",

    "link": "https://share.osf.io/preprint/E00A3-278-D76",
    "description": "Pollution has been a major threat to the sustainability of the commons. In the Tragedy of the Commons, Garrett Hardin explained that freedom to add to a commons can expose it to pollution (Hardin, 1968). Behaviours of individuals who add to the commons should thus be governed if it is to be protected from pollution. In the context of shared natural resources, we have plenty of evidence that this is true. Consequently, to protect them from pollution we now have some safeguards to govern what is added to the common pool and how it is added. Yet, while significant attention has been given to pollution in natural resources, how it emerges in the case of shared knowledge has received little attention. As a shared resource, knowledge is valuable when it grows and is enriched. The sustainability of the knowledge commons rests on the community adding to the common pool. Yet, as some commons scholars have argued, an addition to the common pool doesn\u2019t necessarily increase the value of the knowledge commons. Some could increase it, while others could decrease it (Coriat, 2011; Kranich, 2007; Lougee, 2007; Ostrom & Hess, 2007). In this article, I will focus on how behaviours of adding to the knowledge commons expose it to the threat of pollution. What is pollution in the knowledge commons and how does it occur? Why does it occur? How can a knowledge commons be protected from it? And what are the challenges that emerge in doing so?",

    "description": "For a considerable period of time, peer review has been regarded as the cornerstone of academic journals and scientific communication, ensuring the high quality and reliability of published materials. However, in the early decades of the 21st century, a growing number of scholars began to challenge the traditional peer review procedure, questioning its efficacy. This study aims to provide a fresh perspective on the peer review mechanism, with the objective of enhancing the implementation of scientific communication's functionalities. The research employs historical analysis techniques and modelling methods based on Business Process Model and Notation (BPMN) to compare diverse review models in terms of their influence on scientific communication. BPMN is a conventional tool employed for modelling and describing business processes. The evolution of the peer review procedure is explored, encompassing an examination of the factors contributing to current and future transformations in the publishing realm. The author refers to the crisis of the conventional peer review system and the growing prevalence of preprints, serving as exemplars of these transformations. Finally, suggestions for the implementation of the post-publication review workflow in Russia are provided. \u0414\u043e\u043b\u0433\u043e\u0435 \u0432\u0440\u0435\u043c\u044f

    "link": "https://share.osf.io/preprint/E0073-659-E1F",
    "description": "Social science research gives rise to what we call the \u2018refugee mobility puzzle\u2019: While restrictions on the freedom of residence limit refugees\u2019 socio-economic integration, those who do not face such restrictions often move to areas with high unemployment that similarly hinder their labor market prospects. This study addresses a central element of this puzzle: What draws refugees to high unemployment areas? We propose the spatial overlap hypothesis arguing that refugees in comparatively generous reception systems initially prioritize or are forced to prioritize non-labor-market resources such as affordable housing and proximity to social networks. Thereby they often settle in areas with general economic disadvantage as such areas frequently overlap with said resources. Based on the IAB-BAMF-SOEP Survey of Refugees this study tracks residential histories of more than 2,400 refugee respondents across all German counties and postcodes. Discrete choice models show that preferences for cities, lack of affordable housing, the presence of small, service-oriented companies, and co-ethnic communities explain refugees\u2019 gravitation to disadvantaged areas. These results support the spatial overlap hypothesis and suggest that recently approved refugees face trade-offs: area characteristics that are initially attractive tend to spatially overlap with such that likely inhibit longer-term integration prospects.",

    "title": "Families of Austerity: Benefit Cuts and Family Stress in the UK",
    "link": "https://share.osf.io/preprint/E01FC-3DC-338",
    "description": "Benefit cutbacks have been prominent after the Great Recession. The Family Economic Stress Model (FESM) theorises how financial losses such as those spurred by cutbacks might adversely affect parental and child well-being. Yet few links with policy have been established. We extend current knowledge by comprehensively assessing how benefits cutbacks may affect parents and their adolescent children. We rely on the first ten waves of the UK Household Longitudinal Study (2009-2019) and an event-study approach to examine the aftermath of an exceptional raft of benefit cutbacks. We find that mothers with lower incomes and single mothers accumulated losses equal to 20-30% of their household benefit income. Mothers could not fully compensate for such benefit income losses via their extra earnings, despite increased workforce participation. Financial worries, some forms of material hardship, and mental health worsened among mothers with lower incomes and single mothers exposed to cutbacks. Adolescent socio-emotional difficulties also increased in the period. We find little evidence, though, that cutbacks disrupted parenting. Parents thus display more agency than that accorded by the FESM. Nonetheless, findings point to deepening socioeconomic divides in financial and mental well-being, questioning the rationale for cutbacks.",

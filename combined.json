    "description": "Babies in the United States fare worse than their peers in other high-income countries, and their well-being is starkly unequal along socioeconomic and racialized lines. Newborn health predicts adult well-being, making these inequalities consequential. Policymakers and scholars seeking to improve newborn health and reduce inequality have recently looked to direct cash transfers as a viable intervention. We examine the only unconditional cash transfer in the United States, the Alaska Permanent Fund Dividend (PFD), to learn if giving pregnant people money improves their newborns\u2019 health. Alaska has paid its residents a significant dividend annually since 1982. The dividend\u2019s size varies yearly and is exogenous to Alaskans and the local economy, permitting us to make causal claims. After accounting for fertility selection, we find that receiving cash during pregnancy has no meaningful effect on newborn health. Current theory focuses on purchasing power and status mechanisms to delineate how money translates into health. It cannot illuminate this null finding. This case illustrates a weakness with current theory: it does not provide clear expectations for interventions. We propose four components that must be considered in tandem to predict whether proposed interventions will work.",

    "description": "How does work come to be constructed as a service to the worker? In the United States, the payment of subminimum wages to disabled workers has been legal since 1938 and was entrenched by 1986 legislation eliminating the previously mandated floor of 50 percent of the minimum wage. This article draws on primary historical materials to explain the passage of these amendments, which I analyze as a case of delaborization, a process through which work is mystified as such and reclassified as something else (e.g., service). I find that the managers of segregated workshops for disabled manual laborers rose to control disability employment policy in the aftermath of deinstitutionalization. Professionals mobilized disability stigma to frame the subminimum wage as a social welfare issue subject to their expertise and to lobby successfully for its entrenchment. Weaknesses in the disability\u2013labor coalition enabled this seizure of jurisdiction. This research illuminates professional expertise, the withdrawal of labor unions, and identity-based stigma as major mechanisms driving delaborization, an important contemporary influence on the organization of work. The case of the subminimum wage thus develops sociological literatures on labor, disability, and politics.",

    "description": "Lawmakers are routinely confronted by urgent social issues, yet they hold conflicting policy preferences, incentives, and goals that can undermine collaboration. How do lawmakers collaborate on solutions to urgent issues in the presence of conflicts? I argue that by building mutual trust, networks provide a mechanism to overcome the risks conflict imposes on policy collaboration. But, in doing so, network dependence constrains lawmakers\u2019 ability to react to the problems that motivate policy action beyond their immediate connections. I test this argument using machine learning and longitudinal analysis of federal crime legislation co-sponsorship networks between 1979 and 2005, a period of rising political elite polarization. Results show that elite polarization increased the effects of reciprocal action and prior collaboration on crime legislation co-sponsorships while suppressing the effect of violent crime rates. These relationships vary only marginally by political party and are pronounced for ratified criminal laws. The findings provide new insights to the role of collaboration networks in the historical development of the carceral state and elucidate how political actors pursue collective policy action on urgent issues in the presence of conflict.",

    "description": "Recent religious declines in the United States are for a large part driven by the growing number of Americans who were raised religiously but left religion in the transition to adulthood. Nonetheless, their views and behaviors may still be influenced by their religious upbringing. We explore such legacy effects by examining how changing religiosity during the transition to adulthood influences volunteering among young adults. Analyzing panel data from the National Study of Youth and Religion, we estimate two types of effects: effects of cumulative religious trajectories in youth, and effects of religiosity in youth that are not mediated by religiosity in adulthood. We find that histories of religious involvement shape volunteering in adulthood, but the precise nature of such effects varies across dimensions of religiosity and types of volunteering. Religious service attendance in youth promotes volunteering in adulthood mostly indirectly, through influencing religiosity in adulthood, and exclusively for activities organized by religious groups. By contrast, religious identification in youth promotes volunteering in adulthood also through other channels, and its effects on secular volunteering may persist even when people are not religious in adulthood. We discuss the implications of these findings in light of ongoing declines in religiosity in the United States.",

    "description": "Lynching remains a common form of collective punishment for alleged wrongdoers in Latin America, Africa, and Asia today. Unlike other kinds of collective violence, lynching is usually not carried out by standing organizations. How do lynch mobs overcome the high barriers to violent collective action? I argue that they draw on local community ties to compensate for a lack of centralized organization. Lynch mobs benefit from solidarity and peer pressure, which facilitate collective action. The study focuses on Mexico, where lynching is prevalent and often amounts to the collective beating of thieves. Based on original survey data from Mexico City and a novel lynching event dataset covering the whole of Mexico, I find that individuals with more ties in their communities participate more often in lynching, and municipalities with more highly integrated communities have higher lynching rates. As community ties and lynching may be endogenously related, I also examine the posited mechanisms and the causal direction. Findings reveal that municipalities exposed to a recent major earthquake\u2014an event that tends to increase community ties\u2014subsequently experienced increased levels of lynching. Importantly, I find that interpersonal trust is unrelated to lynching, thus showing that different aspects of social capital have diverging consequences for collective violence, with community ties revealing a \u201cdark side.\u201d",

    "description": "Cultural capital is a central concept in stratification research. Crucial to the Bourdieusian habitus, upper strata familiarity with the dominant culture is assumed to be ingrained via socialization, allowing its members to smoothly navigate educational institutions and higher segments of the labor market. Although cultural capital is deemed partially implicit, such \u201cnon-declarative\u201d or \u201cembodied\u201d cultural capital has largely escaped empirical scrutiny; arguments about its importance are typically post hoc interpretations of associations between measures of declarative cultural capital (survey items on elite cultural consumption) and variables of interest. To advance stratification research, we developed tools to empirically capture non-declarative cultural capital: Implicit Association Tests (IATs) measuring (1) positive association and (2) self-identification with elite culture, embedded in a survey fielded among a high-quality panel representative of the Dutch population (n\u2009=\u20092,436). We find our IATs validly measure non-declarative cultural capital. As expected, scores are only weakly coupled with declarative cultural capital, and associated with (parental) socioeconomic position. Using these IATs liberates non-declarative cultural capital from its deus ex machina status and answers the black-box critique of the Bourdieusian habitus as an explanation for socially stratified patterns across a range of fields.",

    "description": "Why do elite professionals leave hard-earned, privileged corporate careers? This article examines an underappreciated case of employee turnover, white-collar opt-out, which involves resignations that may not immediately lead to a similar job or life experience, but are instead followed by alternatives to fast-track careers, including seeking another occupation, stay-at-home parenting, or pursuit of leisure and self-exploration. Drawing on 70 in-depth interviews with Turkish professional-managerial employees of transnational corporations located in both Istanbul and New York City, I examine their narratives about the quality of working life and their decisions to opt out through the lenses of worker consent and alienation. I identify the lack of work-life balance and fulfillment with one\u2019s labor as drivers of opting out, showing how these push factors, combined with various pull factors of non-working life and safety nets, encourage elite workers to overcome status anxiety and abandon corporate careers. The article extends labor process theory insights into high-paying corporate occupations, illuminating how so-called \u201cgood jobs\u201d may produce a relatively low quality of working life. It also exposes the inherent limits of resource-centered approaches to inequality, showing how alienating work can undermine the quality of life of even upwardly mobile, high-skilled workers.",

This article recounts my sociological adventures, from efforts to understand the world as I found it in the early 1960s to my responses to current reactionary trends.

Our review of this interdisciplinary scholarship describes the range of views people hold, the attitudes and behaviors associated with them, and what factors contribute to these views. We focus primarily on essentialism and constructivism, although we describe the greater variety of beliefs beyond this dichotomy, as well as fluidity in how people use these concepts.

We focus on a selective subset of contributions aligning with four broad topics: causal effect identification and estimation in general, causal effect heterogeneity, causal effect mediation, and temporal and spatial interference. We describe how machine learning, as an estimation strategy, can be effectively combined with causal inference, which has been traditionally concerned with identification. The incorporation of machine learning in causal inference enables researchers to better address potential biases in estimating causal effects and uncover heterogeneous causal effects. Uncovering sources of effect heterogeneity is key for generalizing to populations beyond those under study. While sociology has long emphasized the importance of causal mechanisms, historical and life-cycle variation, and social contexts involving network interactions, recent conceptual and computational advances facilitate more principled estimation of causal effects under these settings. We encourage sociologists to incorporate these insights into their empirical research.",

Then the role of cultural objects in stabilizing and destabilizing meaning and social arrangements is discussed.

Our framework presents age as a system of inequality that can be understood through concepts and processes that operate at multiple levels of analysis. At the individual level, we argue age is best conceptualized and operationalized as multidimensional. We review a range of measures, from birth cohort to physical appearance, that can be fruitfully combined in empirical research to account for this complexity.

This article provides a guide to this scholarship. We show how the political nature of cross-border movements creates and circumscribes conditions for diasporic political mobilization. We then identify the different types of cross-border political activities and the modalities of corresponding home state policies.

    "description": "The doctoral dissertation often shapes the career that follows it, influencing both opportunities encountered and research conducted. This article describes the ways this has been true for me and then argues that, given the dissertation's importance, graduate programs do not focus sufficiently on strategies for conceiving research. As a result, many students flounder at the dissertation proposal stage. Drawing on the role of doubt in my career and in science more generally, I propose changes in doctoral programs to reduce the problem.",

    "description": "Recent years have witnessed a surge of interest in artificial intelligence (AI). To address AI\u2019s growing visibility and importance, the authors edited a special collection that showcases cutting-edge sociological research on AI in areas such as health and medicine, work and labor, new research methodologies, and policy. The articles collectively position AI as a sociotechnical system, recognizing that AI integrates heterogeneous elements that intertwine the social and the technical. Each article brings different aspects of sociotechnical systems to light. The authors highlight three contributions sociologists are poised to make to the study of AI: (1) critical analysis of AI hype, promotion, and adoption; (2) empirical study of AI\u2019s co-constitution with processes of social life; and (3) identification of avenues for structural change in creating equitable AI futures. The authors call for the development of novel research methods to study distributed AI platforms and for future research on inequalities, power, and data justice.",

    "description": "Although we now know that disaster and climate migration is complex and nonlinear, less is known about how migrants from environmentally threatened areas are affected by disasters back home. This study centers the perspectives and care of 30 migrants from several high-risk coastal Louisiana communities who helped their kin in the wake of Hurricane Ida (2021). In fusing the disaster migration and disaster care literature, it illustrates how migrants engage in gendered care work from afar. It also shows how gender shapes decision making to stay in or stay attached to such environments and even perpetuates the need for future care. The theoretical concept of a \u201cdisaster carescape\u201d is proposed to highlight intergenerational care across time and space while emphasizing place (environmentally threatened landscapes) and place attachment in shaping these care relations. The author concludes by suggesting that disaster carescapes will be important to understand as demographics in climate-affected areas shift during this century.",

Using a unique survey experiment with a demographically representative sample of 1,032 individuals, the authors examine how negative feedback mechanisms, a critical aspect of the online environment, affect men\u2019s and women\u2019s intention to participate in these discussions. The authors focus on two feedback mechanisms: dislike and deletion. The findings suggest that dislike does not discourage women from participating in online political discussions. However, women show significantly lower participation intentions when their posts risk deletion. In contrast, men\u2019s participation intentions are not deterred by either feedback mechanism. These findings suggest that context-specific feedback mechanisms are important in understanding the gender gap in online political participation, emphasizing women\u2019s sensitivity to online environments where their contributions might be erased.",

The hypothesis is based on the tendency of first- and second-generation immigrants to exhibit higher levels of religiosity compared with the host populations. Simulation analysis involving more than 15,000 respondents of data from the 2014 to 2021 German General Social Survey indicates that the increase in the immigrant population during this period does not emerge as a substantial counterforce to religious decline in both eastern and western Germany. An effective slowdown of secularization in Germany would have required a more substantial increase in immigration, a notably higher level of religious engagement among new arrivals and their descendants than was observed, and a reduced pace of secularization among them.",

I find that, on average, trust and support are lower among cost-related movers. My findings suggest that cost-related movers might be less trusting because they tend to be more wary of strangers, which could include their neighbors. They further suggest that cost-related movers might be less likely to have neighbors they can count on for support because they are more likely to perceive their neighborhoods as unsafe.

Men in state firms report significantly higher odds of preferring to lay off women first, but this effect is even stronger in private firms. As symbols of economic stability, state firms are prohibited from conducting layoffs, creating insulated organizational cultures with traditional gender role beliefs that are resistant to change. Meanwhile, private firms are governed by a firm logic of profit maximization that creates more precarity among workers and compels them, men and even women, to embrace layoffs of fellow women workers to protect themselves.",

    "description": "Throughout its history, the real estate industry has emphasized privacy and exclusion in housing advertisements, helping entrench patterns of residential segregation in the process. Recently, however, some forms of neighborhood-level social diversity are becoming more common, as indicated by the growing number of neighborhoods that are mixed-income. Does the proliferation of income-diverse neighborhoods suggest that advertisers are curtailing their exclusionary rhetoric when marketing homes in mixed-income communities? To answer this question, this study analyzes over one million Craigslist rental listings posted in the 100 largest U.S. metropolitan areas in July and August of 2019. Findings show that real estate advertisers continue to rely on rhetorical strategies that likely reinforce, if not encourage, privacy and exclusion in mixed-income neighborhoods. Specifically, rental advertisements in mixed-income neighborhoods were disproportionately likely to mention that the advertised unit came with a home security device, a rhetorical tool likely aimed at calming homeseekers\u2019 apprehension toward living in an income-diverse neighborhood. This finding suggests that scholars have underexamined the strategies that real estate actors use to persuade homeseekers to live in diverse neighborhoods. Furthermore, the security rhetoric prevalent in income-diverse neighborhoods may encourage homeseekers\u2019 fears of mixed-income settings and impede cross-class social integration.",

The authors orient sociologists to the rapidly evolving AI policy landscape by defining AI and by contrasting two leading approaches to AI governance: a safety-based and an equity-based approach. The authors argue that the safety-based approach is the predominant one but is inadequate. They suggest that sociologists can shift AI policymaking to prioritize equity by examining corporate political power in AI policy debates and by organizing research around four sociological questions centered on equity and public engagement.

The authors argue that public redistribution affects the level of net wealth by moderating the household-level association of income and wealth. Drawing on microdata for 14 countries from the Luxembourg Wealth Study, and spending and revenue data from the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development, the authors use ordinary least squares models with country fixed effects. The authors find a positive moderation effect of social spending and a negative moderation effect of income taxation. Higher and lower labor incomes translate into higher and lower levels of wealth where income taxation is lower or social spending is higher. The authors complement these findings with panel information from the United States, providing further evidence supporting the cross-national results. In summary, public redistribution partially accounts for differences in the association of income and wealth across countries. The authors urge future research on the correlation of income and wealth to take public redistribution into account.",

Experimental surveys uncover subconscious same-gender preferences in advice receptivity, contrasting with stated desires for gender-neutral guidance. These implicit affinities persist even when advice content is anonymized and gender-balanced. Paradoxically, finfluencers introduce diverse voices and challenge traditional norms yet also subtly cater to gendered perspectives.

Black and Latino workers are overrepresented in high-strain jobs at many ages, compared with other groups. Exposure to job strain across working ages shows more variation in exposure by gender and race/ethnicity groups than static measures.

Results uncover how AI designers use narratives around missing data on vulnerable populations as justifications for the creation of synthetic data that were artificially manufactured rather than generated by real-world events. Although this was a profitable business model for AI companies, these practices ultimately situated long-term care residents as voiceless in the development of AI.

I show that Democratic party power, higher political spending from environmental organizations, lower investor-owned utility market share, higher publicly owned utility market share, and lower levels of fossil fuel production and political spending lead to more stringent policies. In contrast, weaker policies are more likely in states where the prototypical opponents of climate policy, Republican politicians and oil and gas interests, have greater power.",

    "description": "During the COVID-19 pandemic, nonbinary and genderfluid adults did information work to discover their gender identities as they explored information on social media, online, and in person. Due to cisnormative restrictions, this information was necessary to identify and validate their gender identity as authentic. During the pandemic, more nonbinary people were able to self-recognize their own gender because there was more time for reflection and more access to nonbinary narratives online, including representations of nonbinary life that defied White, thin, androgynous ideals. By analyzing interviews with 22 U.S. adults who came out as nonbinary during the pandemic, this qualitative study contributes to both the sociological study of nonbinary identity development and to the information science literature on deeply meaningful and profoundly personal information work. This study also contributes to further understanding of why it seems like more nonbinary and genderfluid people \u201ccame out\u201d during the height of the pandemic.",

We revisit DiMaggio and Powell and examine the shift in isomorphic behaviors that occur during a crisis, illustrating how shocks result in the use of nontraditional practices. We empirically examine the impact of the 2008 economic crisis on U.S. art museums\u2019 isomorphic referent transitions in the use of market practices before and after the crisis, covering 2006 to 2011. Our findings indicate that museums altered the scope of mimetic isomorphism, and as a result, U.S. art museums sought solutions by shifting reference groups that were structurally (leader vs. peer), physically (geographical region), or organizational (social networks) proximate during the crisis. We elaborate our understanding of isomorphic behavior as a key factor during times of crisis that destabilized institutional environments, both symbolic and resource spaces. This finding can be generalized to other organizational settings beyond art museums.",

    "description": "Our study reevaluates the impact of commuting on mental health, challenging the prevailing view of commuting solely as a job-related demand or stressor that leads to increased mental health problems. Using the 2011 Neighbourhood Effects on Health and Well-Being Study from Toronto, we explore the dual perspectives of commuting distance as a stressful demand versus a potentially beneficial resource among parents of minor children (n\u2009=\u2009299). Multivariate results reveal that commuting distance alone is not significantly linked to mental health as measured by psychological distress. However, the nature of commuting\u2014whether it is viewed as a demand or a resource\u2014depends on other factors in parents\u2019 lives. Specifically, our results indicate that an increase in commuting distance exacerbates the negative effects of work hours on psychological distress while simultaneously buffering against the impact of work-to-family conflict on this outcome irrespective of gender.",

Ratings of adolescent facial attractiveness are predictive of later life outcomes among women, but mainly because ratings of young women\u2019s attractiveness are closely connected with women\u2019s socioeconomic standing and body mass in early life. The same is not true for men.

In particular, the authors examine how the interplay between artists\u2019 collaborations and shared references changed throughout Hollywood\u2019s history. Using data from the Internet Movie Database and applying relational hyperevent models, the authors analyze the coevolution of collaboration and reference networks among 15,553 Hollywood film professionals who participated in 6,800 films between 1930 and 1999. The authors complement prior sociological efforts through a longitudinal perspective on the structure of social and stylistic networks across three meaningful historical periods: before, during, and after Hollywood\u2019s artistic transformation in the 1960s. The findings show that filmmakers are more likely to collaborate if they previously used the same references, but they are less likely to adopt the references of their previous collaborators. In addition, the results highlight that the structure of relational processes in cultural fields varies over time as the contextual conditions for tie formation change.",

Drawing on ethnographic research and interviews, the author analyzes how digital psychiatry researchers become \u201cmoral entrepreneurs,\u201d actors who wield their social influence to define ethical conduct, through two practices. First, researchers engage in moral discovery, identifying gaps in regulation as opportunities to articulate ethical standards.

With these techniques, digital psychiatry researchers demonstrate ethical innovation is essential to their professional identity. Yet ultimately, the author demonstrates how moral entrepreneurship erects barriers to participation in ethical decision making and constrains the focus of ethical consideration.",

    "description": "Drawing on ethnographic, interview, and textual data with researchers creating machine learning solutions for health care, the author explains how researchers justify their projects while grappling with uncertainties about the benefits and harms of machine learning. Researchers differentiate between a hypothesized world of machine learning and a \u201creal\u201d world of clinical practice. Each world relates to distinct frameworks for describing, evaluating, and reconciling uncertainties. In the hypothesized world, impacts are hypothetical. They can be operationalized, controlled, and computed as bias and fairness. In the real world, impacts address patient outcomes in clinical settings. Real impacts are chaotic and uncontrolled and relate to complex issues of equity. To address real-world uncertainties, researchers collaborate closely with clinicians, who explain real-world implications, and participate in data generation projects to improve clinical datasets. Through these collaborations, researchers expand ethical discussions, while delegating moral responsibility to clinicians and medical infrastructure. This preserves the legitimacy of machine learning as a pure, technical domain, while allowing engagement with health care impacts. This article contributes an explanation of the interplay between technical and moral boundaries in shaping ethical dilemmas and responsibilities, and explains the significance of collaboration in artificial intelligence projects for ethical engagement.",

Between-workplace closure mechanisms tend to be absent or weak for all comparisons, but within-workplace occupational closure and within-job pay disparities are present for all and quite large for most groups. Within-job earnings inequalities tend to be largest for Black, Hispanic, and Native American women and smallest for Asian and Native American men.

Among Hispanic White individuals, a presumed immigrant-dominant group, there is no age at which the majority of members are foreign born. Alternatively, among non-Hispanic Asians and Pacific Islanders, Hispanics from other races, and multiracial Hispanics, there is a clear divide between majority foreign-born and majority native-born age groups.

    "description": "Scholars have linked income inequality to the recent success of radical-right parties and movements. Yet research shows that inequality reduces participation among groups likely to support the radical right and promotes support for redistribution, an issue championed by the radical left. This raises questions about why, if at all, inequality matters for radical-right politics. The author reconciles previous arguments by developing a theory that connects these phenomena through the process of boundary consolidation. He argues that inequality generates status threats that prompt exclusionary shifts in national group boundaries. This promotes ethnonationalism, a restrictive conception of national membership and, ultimately, support for the radical right, whose mobilization relies on ethnonationalist appeals. Analyses of time-series cross-sectional data from 38 countries support this theory, revealing that inequality is associated with greater ethnonationalism, with distinct associations by income and ethnicity, and that ethnonationalism strongly predicts radical-right voting. The author thus demonstrates how long-term structural changes are linked to contemporary radical politics and how arguments setting economic and cultural causes of the radical right in opposition are inadequate.",

    "description": "Studies of social capital usually emphasize its prosocial, deviance-reducing effects. This article instead explores its negative potential. The authors focus on the relationship between different forms of community-level social capital and tax avoidance by wealthy Americans, using data from the Panama Papers leaks to analyze the residential communities of Americans who engaged in offshore tax avoidance. The analysis demonstrates, first, that communities with more civic organizations are more likely to have tax avoiders. This finding suggests that civic organizations may promote cohesion among wealthy elites, producing insular attitudes and deviance. Second, income inequality correlates with tax avoidance, indicating that highly unequal communities have more insular elites. Finally, more patriotic communities have lower tax avoidance. These findings empirically establish the concept of \u201cnegative social capital\u201d and advance the distinction between bridging (or cross-group) social capital, which lowers deviance, and bonding (or within-group) social capital, which is actually associated with greater elite deviance.",

    "description": "Trans people\u2019s gender identity is frequently cited as a source of health care denial, even when it has no bearing on their symptom presentation. A latent belief among health care workers that trans people are fundamentally different from cis people is deeply implicated in the finding that between one fifth and one third of trans people have been denied care because of their gender identity. In this study, the authors use data from a nationally representative survey (n\u2009=\u20092,458) to examine whether Americans believe a doctor who denies care to a trans patient on the basis of claims of inadequate training. The authors find a majority of Americans trust this explanation. These views are more common among Evangelicals and Republicans, whereas Black respondents are less inclined to deem this justification valid. Qualitative analyses reveal that those who accept the doctor\u2019s rationale are more likely to acquiesce to doctors\u2019 medical knowledge, to assert that doctors have professional discretion in making referrals, and to reference complications stemming from the patient\u2019s presumed receipt of gender-affirming care despite the routine nature of their sick visit. These findings indicate that doctors\u2019 enduring cultural authority powerfully intersects with \u201ctrans exceptionalism\u201d to inform Americans\u2019 perspectives on the denial of care to trans people.",

Jails are the front door of the criminal legal system and admit millions of people each year. Yet jails have received little attention in sociological research, and existing research tends to focus on large, urban facilities. Here the author analyzes panel data organized at the county-year level to depict variation in four measures of jail incarceration across the rural-urban continuum since 1978. The author finds that jail incarceration rates have tended to increase across the period, but the urban incarceration rate has declined since 2007 as the rural incarceration rate continues to increase. Most people in jail are legally innocent and have not been convicted of a crime, and the Black/white disparity in jail incarceration has decreased over time.",

Is this because, until recently, immigrant protest was minimal or limited in scope? The authors take a macro-comparative approach, recoding the Dynamics of Collective Action dataset to compare proimmigrant collective action with paradigmatic, well-studied movements from 1960 to 1995. The authors find that immigrant collective action was on par with iconic movements, mobilized similar numbers of people, occurred across the United States, engaged in disruptive action, and encompassed a wide range of origins, thus correcting possible misperceptions that immigrants did not engage in contentious action before the 1990s. The authors conclude by advocating for a population at risk focus for studying the emergence of collective action, decentering the borders of collective mobilization, and illuminating the vulnerabilities of legal status.",

The authors examine three sources of emotional support (friends, family, and partners) and their association with three mental health outcomes (depression, anxiety, and loneliness) separately for cisgender men and cisgender women. The authors find that emotional support plays a larger role in the association between sexual identity and mental health for cisgender men than cisgender women. Regardless of gender, bisexual individuals have consistently higher levels of depression, anxiety, and loneliness across all models, and this difference is not attenuated by emotional support.",

Using an original survey of Canadian women (n\u2009=\u20091,181), the authors examine religious affiliation and attendance, abortion attitudes, and self-reported abortion experience.

The increased use of fines and fees has been likened to a predatory system that exploits the most vulnerable groups to fill state and local budget gaps. States have begun limiting suspensions for unpaid traffic tickets out of economic and racial equity concerns, but many still sanction drivers for failing to appear in court or comply with other regulations. Merging the full universe of New York Department of Motor Vehicles suspension records in 2017 with the American Community Survey at the zip code level, we find that Black, Hispanic, and economically disadvantaged communities were disproportionately impacted by both nonpayment and noncompliance suspensions. Predictive models suggest that reforms ending suspensions for both the failure to appear in traffic court and the failure to pay traffic tickets could substantially reduce these disparities.",

    "description": "On the one hand, previous research argues that growth in rural populations leads to forest loss from clearing trees to make room for the growing population and their farming needs. On the other hand, research is also concerned with how deforestation drives people out of rural areas, leading to overurbanization. From this work, it is clear that the movement of people has an important relationship to forest loss, but it is less clear what the autonomy of people is in this process. Put differently, more focus has been put on state-level economic and environmental factors than political factors when considering the impact of domestic migration on forest loss. Although there has been substantial work on how political factors, like democracy, impact forest loss, there is less research on how political rights, like freedom of domestic movement, may impact forest loss. To build on this research, we test the impact of freedom of domestic movement and democracy on forest loss from 2001 to 2014 for a sample of 107 low- and middle-income nations. We find support for the idea that having more freedom of movement decreases forest loss in more democratic nations compared to less democratic nations. We also find that both rural and urban population growth, among others, is associated with higher levels of forest loss. Together, our findings suggest that the freedom of domestic movement should be taken into consideration in addition to population growth from actual domestic movement when researching forest loss.",

The authors applied an innovative research design to underscore different sources of selection. Overall, no concrete evidence was found for the positive effect of teleworking on workers\u2019 self-reported health, quality of sleep, and psychosomatic conditions. The ostensible better health outcomes among teleworkers could be partially explained by the positive selection on both prior levels and prior trajectories of health into teleworking. Moreover, the health impacts of telework were contingent on workers\u2019 gender and parenthood status and the intensity of teleworking. These findings indicate that the positive association between teleworking and health appears to reflect selection bias rather than a causal relationship in Germany before the COVID-19 pandemic.",

I implement a multiregional input-output approach to operationalize these emission components. Using the MEP framework and dynamic fixed-effects models with the seemingly unrelated regression estimator, I find these four emission components are heterogeneously related to national affluence in high-income nations. As these nations become even wealthier, affluence is gradually decoupled from emissions generated by domestic-oriented supply chain activities and direct end-user emissions, yet it remains strongly coupled with the other two emission components in distinct ways.

However, following these events, a positive association emerged between support for anti-gay views and anti-Ukrainian sentiment.

Multilevel models analyzing Demographic and Health Survey Program data on women from 50 low- and middle-income countries emphasize the collision of global scripts with local constraints: In low contraceptive contexts, education is associated with higher risk of unintended pregnancy.

    "description": "Few researchers have considered how gentrification affects inequalities of housing wealth between Black and White neighborhoods. Drawing on the U.S. census and the American Community Survey, I test the hypothesis that home values rise more slowly in gentrifying neighborhoods that are majority Black compared to those that are majority White. I find that home values appreciate more quickly in gentrifying neighborhoods that are majority Black, particularly those that are experiencing significant change in their racial-ethnic composition. The findings further suggest that Black gentrifying neighborhoods experiencing racial transition\u2014a large increase in the proportion of White residents and a large decrease in the proportion of Black residents\u2014experience higher rates of home value appreciation than those not experiencing racial transition. I argue that gentrification reproduces the racial stratification of urban neighborhoods because large increases to housing wealth tend to be coupled with the arrival of the White middle-class.",

For young people, the relationship between feminism and support for transgender women is unequivocally positive. Among older people, by contrast, feminists are polarized. They are more likely than nonfeminists to strongly support trans women but also more likely to strongly oppose them. Whether this polarization is peculiar to Britain, where the transgender movement has met with particularly strong countermobilization, is a question for future research.",

    "description": "The timing of childbirth has undergone significant changes in the past decades. However, it may not be feasible for individuals with many children to further delay the timing of each childbirth given the biological constraints on fecundability and social age deadline for childbirth. Thus, the delay in having children and the increasing heterogeneity in its timing may present different trends when analyzed retrospectively by completed number of children. This study investigates the age at childbirth by birth order among women age 40+ in 17 European countries and Canada based on the number of children they have. Our findings show that individuals having more children tend to have each child at earlier ages, with less variation in timing, compared to the counterparts with fewer children. This suggests that changes in the timing of childbirth are more pronounced among individuals having fewer children and less so among those with having more children.",

    "description": "Research on populist attitudes and populist leaders\u2019 narratives has largely overlooked what happens to populist attitudes after a populist is elected, especially among the populist\u2019s supporters. Existing literature points to two possible directions of change. On one hand, if populist attitudes stem from a perceived lack of representation, then we would expect people\u2019s populist attitudes to decrease once their preferred candidate is in power. On the other hand, scholars have observed that populist politicians in power continue to deploy populist rhetoric, suggesting that their supporters\u2019 populist attitudes should stay constant or even increase. In this project, the author focuses on Donald Trump and his supporters to explore this mechanism. Drawing on a national survey conducted around the 2016 and 2020 elections, the author shows that Trump\u2019s supporters saw a significant decrease in populist attitudes after he came into power compared with both other American voters and other Republicans. The author also demonstrates that this decrease in populist attitudes is associated with changes in the level of \u201cfeeling represented.\u201d On the basis of these findings, the author argues that populist attitudes are driven by feelings of lack of representation over other mechanisms.",

Drawing on 32 interviews and nine months of fieldwork in Tokyo, the author describes how one of the largest foreign conversation schools in Japan (NOVA) has invested in broadcasting whiteness and English skill as traits of authentic native speakers. This process depends on who is viewed as a valuable teacher, but it also depends on migrants who pursue life in Japan through language teaching. Work at NOVA is highly exploitative. Yet because most of the workforce has ulterior motivations, they are willing to exchange substandard work for the privilege of mobility. This case highlights the overlaps between lifestyle migration and native speakerism at the organizational level and how supposedly \u201cwin-win\u201d arrangements with labor create an enduring, material setting for the reproduction of ideology.",

The authors find no differences in the influence of birth spacing on the likelihood of returning to an employer versus changing employers but that shorter birth spacings relate to lower likelihoods of returning to the labor market. There is some evidence that birth spacing and postbirth employment varies by age at first birth, marital status, and occupation. Overall, the results suggest that although birth spacing is relevant for returning postbirth to employment, job changes are unlikely to drive mothers\u2019 wage penalties.",

Our findings confirm that all types of polarization increase engagement, but party affiliation plays an important role in the process. Polarizing rhetoric from Republicans generally elicits a stronger reaction relative to that from Democrats. The exception is an increase in retweets of issue-based polarization when posted by Democrats.

The authors analyze four restricted-use national survey datasets to investigate racial disparities in college attendance outcomes from the 1980s through the 2010s. Although college entrance rates increased for all racial groups, Black and Hispanic youth became increasingly less likely than their White peers to attend four-year selective colleges.

Drawing on a national probability survey collected in 2021 (n\u2009=\u20093,390), the authors find that individuals who draw boundaries between religion and science had higher odds of rejecting biological and social explanations of mental health conditions, whereas individuals who see religion and science as collaborative had higher odds of affirming biological and social explanations.

However, an increase in White residents, but not necessarily an increase in high\u2013socioeconomic status residents, is strongly associated with greater propensities.

Using latent class analysis on longitudinal data from the National Health and Aging Trends Study, the authors identify five distinct care network types: spousal care, care exclusively from children, care from both children and other sources, self-care with assistive technology, and care exclusively from nonfamily sources. Further analysis, including multinomial logistic regression and latent transition analysis, reveals that when a spouse is available, older adults, particularly older men, are more likely to rely on spousal care. However, in cases in which spouses and/or children are unavailable, older adults are inclined to turn to diverse care networks involving nontraditional caregivers or resort to self-care using assistive technologies. Additionally, declining health conditions are associated with a higher likelihood of receiving care from more varied care networks.

To help illuminate these factors, future research should explore whether the counties with high shares of couples but low shares of same-sex couples are also areas where inclusivity tends to be lagging.",

    "description": "Online enrollments in public universities have soared, in part because of universities\u2019 increasing reliance on for-profit online program managers (OPMs) for everything from instructional design to student recruitment. However, scholarship has indicated that OPMs may play a role in producing predatory forms of inclusion in higher education for marginalized students. To identify mechanisms through which this might occur, the authors conduct a mixed-methods analysis of 161 contracts between OPMs and two- and four-year public universities, an original database of third-party financing structure, and university webpages. The analysis identifies several contract features\u2014targeting, extraction, opacity, and captivity\u2014that may help concentrate marginalized students in extractive or exploitative online programs at public universities. The authors also show that OPMs funded by private equity or venture capital are most likely to include contract features that incentivize aggressive revenue production and promote the recruitment of marginalized students in online, but not in-person, programs.",

    "description": "AbstractScholars and policymakers are increasingly interested in subjective well-being as a development indicator. However, sociological research on this topic is quite limited, as is research that considers the effects of the biophysical environment on subjective well-being. In this study, we address these gaps in the literature by examining social and environmental influences on life satisfaction, a core component of subjective well-being. We employed multi-level regression analysis using data from over 97,000 individuals living across ninety-six countries. The results demonstrated significant effects of several individual-level variables on life satisfaction, in particular respondents\u2019 satisfaction with their local air and water quality and the efforts being made to preserve the environment in their country, as well as numerous social variables, such as income, gender, and employment status. Among the country-level variables, national gross domestic product per capita was positively associated with higher individual life satisfaction. Income inequality had a negative effect on life satisfaction, while wealth inequality, on the other hand, had a positive effect, a surprising finding we contemplate in some detail. The carbon intensity of a nation\u2019s economy as well as the proportion of a nation\u2019s land in protected areas only influenced life satisfaction when not controlling for the other variables. We conclude by discussing the implications of this research for sustainable development, including the promise of life satisfaction and other measures of subjective well-being as sustainable development indicators.",

    "description": "AbstractSocial movement theory holds that disrupting social and political processes is among the most effective tools social movement organizations (SMOs) use to motivate recognition for themselves and their constituents. Yet, recent research suggests that the political reception of disruption is not racially neutral. Black SMOs face a dilemma in that, although disruption is a powerful tool for change, the public often perceives nonviolent Black disruptive protest as violent. We investigate this bind by analyzing how nondisruptive protest, nonviolent disruption, or violence helps or hinders both Black and non-Black SMOs to gain state \u201cacceptance\u201d as legitimate spokes-organizations for their issues. We combine data on newspaper-reported protest events with data covering 41,545 SMO Congressional testimonies from 1462 SMOs from 35 movement families. In panel regressions, we find that Congress is generally more accepting of nondisruptive protest but that nondisruptive protest is only roughly one-tenth as effective for Black SMOs compared with non-Black SMOs. Furthermore, whereas non-Black SMOs are significantly more likely to testify after using nonviolent disruption, Black SMOs using nonviolent disruption are significantly less likely to testify before Congress. Regardless of race, violence was associated with fewer congressional testimonies. Collectively, these findings suggest that Black SMOs face a tactical bind: Black SMOs can use nondisruptive tactics that are resource-intensive and slow, or they can use nonviolent disruption that gets media attention but hinders congressional acceptance. These findings contribute to a growing literature on how racial inequality and prejudice impact the outcomes of social movements.",

Despite its prominence in public and political discourse, however, there is no systemic evidence on the levels and patterns of school segregation.

Using the 2021 Annual School Survey\u2014an administrative dataset covering all South African schools\u2014and the 2019 Trends in International Mathematics and Science Study school survey, we find very high levels of school segregation along racial as well as socioeconomic lines. White students almost exclusively attend former White schools, have little exposure to the low-income Black majority, and are vastly overrepresented in elite public and private schools. We argue that in South Africa and other contexts with under-resourced education systems, elite capture of the few high-performing schools serves to reproduce race and class privilege.",

    "description": "AbstractThe etiology of psychological differences among those who pursue distinct lines of work have long been of scholarly interest. A prevalent early and continuing assumption is that experiences on the job influence psychological development; contemporary analysts focus on dimensions indicative of mental health. Still, such work-related psychological differences may instead be attributable to selection processes to the extent that individuals can choose, or be selected to, different lines of work, based on their prior characteristics. Whereas much attention has been directed to employment per se as a key determinant of mental health, we consider work status (employed or not) and hours of work, as well as work quality, including both intrinsic and extrinsic dimensions among those who are employed. We also investigate differences in the effects of work experiences on mental health in distinct phases of the work career. Drawing on eleven waves of longitudinal data obtained from a cohort of ninth grade students followed prospectively to age 45\u201346 (54% female; 73% white), we examine whether key psychological dimensions indicative of mental health (mastery, depressive affect, and self-esteem) change in response to employment and to particular experiences on the job. The findings, based on a fixed-effects modeling strategy, indicate that observed psychological differences related to employment and work quality are not attributable to stable individual proclivities. Evidence suggests that mental health is responsive to changing experiences at work from mid-adolescence to mid-life.",

    "description": "AbstractThe mortgage industry is central to ethno-racial stratification in homeownership access. Ample research demonstrates that unequal treatment of minorities has created major differences in the access and exclusion of low-cost loan products in the housing market. While numerous studies have documented the disadvantages Black and Latino homebuyers face, these studies have been limited in their assessment of credit worthiness in accessing a mortgage. This study draws on the annual dataset from the Home Mortgage Disclosure Act from 2018 and 2019 to assess ethno-racial disparities in mortgage outcomes by debt-to-income (DTI) levels. I demonstrate that DTI levels vary tremendously by ethno-racial groups. In addition, I show that loan rejections and high-cost loan originations are highest among Blacks and Latinos across DTI levels compared to White applicants. Depending on the adverse loan outcome, Asians perform similarly or slightly underperform compared to Whites. These trends are particularly true when examining high-cost loan originations as Blacks and Latinos with excellent credit worthiness perform similarly as Whites and Asians with below-average credit worthiness. Implications for ethno-racial stratification are discussed.",

I constructed an original dataset of decisions of corruption cases at the Brazilian Superior Court of Justice (2003\u20132016).

Drawing on 110 interviews with prosecutors and judges and document analysis of criminal charges and judicial decisions, I show that case-focused protests affect judicial behavior through two mechanisms: by threatening the personal reputation of judges and the legitimacy of courts.",

Drawing on theories of intergroup collaboration and policymaking research, I argue that network polarization\u2014low frequencies of collaborative relations between lawmakers belonging to distinct political groups\u2014negatively affects crime legislation passage by reducing information flows, increasing intergroup hostility, and creating opportunities for political attacks. To evaluate this perspective, I recreate dynamic legislative networks between 1979 and 2005 using data on 1,897,019 cosponsorship relationships between 1537 federal lawmakers and the outcomes of 5950 federal crime bills. Results illustrate that increases in partisan network segregation and the number of densely clustered subgroups both have negative effects on bill passage. These relationships are not moderated by majority party status and peak during the 1990s and early 2000s, a period when prison growth showed its first signs of slowing. These findings provide new insight to the relationship between polarization and policy and suggest that increases in network polarization may be partly responsible for declines in crime policy adoption observed in recent decades.",

    "description": "AbstractWhile the progress of the knowledge economy is inexorable, this paper argues that partisan politics and labor market institutions can affect the direction in which the knowledge economy progresses. In particular, a combination of corporatist industrial relations systems and left partisanship tends to foster greater wage restraint, and such a wage outcome tends to encourage the greater adoption of communications technology than information-processing technology in the economy. This reorientation of the knowledge economy toward communications technology, in turn, has egalitarian distributive implications. In particular, the greater adoption of communications technology reduces wage inequality across the board in lower 90\u201310, 50\u201310, as well as 90\u201350 wage ratios. These arguments are tested using data across 15\u201321 OECD countries (1970\u20132015).",

Existing work suggests that people are rationalizing, misinformed, or misled. This article proposes an additional explanation: Inequality itself makes economic and racial disparities difficult to understand. In unequal societies, individuals establish their networks at formative institutions patterned by class and race. As a result, they unwittingly condition on key causal pathways when making descriptive and causal inferences about inequality. We use a simple agent-based model to show that, under circumstances typical to highly stratified societies, individuals will underestimate the extent of economic and racial inequality, downplay the importance of inherited advantages, and overestimate the relative importance of individual ability. Moreover, we show that they will both underestimate the extent of racial discrimination and overestimate its relative importance. Because segregated social worlds bias inference in these ways, all individuals (rich and poor) have principled reasons to favor less redistribution than they would if their social worlds were more integrated.",

    "description": "AbstractTo modernize public service delivery, U.S. communities increasingly rely on 311 systems for residents to request government services. Research on 311 systems is relatively new, and there is mixed evidence on whether 311 can help bridge the gap between disadvantaged communities and governments. This study draws from research on immigration, race/ethnicity, and differential engagement to explore the link between immigrant concentration and 311 usage. We use longitudinal data on 311 requests in Baltimore City, Maryland (2014\u20132019) and spatial panel regression analysis to show that neighborhood racial/ethnic structure and the national policy environment can significantly influence whether immigrant concentration is a barrier for 311 service-seeking. Specifically, we find that immigrant concentration reduces 311 requests in high-immigrant neighborhoods with Latino or Black concentration, but not in high-immigrant neighborhoods with White/Asian concentration. We also find that in Latino high-immigrant neighborhoods, the relationship between immigrant concentration and 311 requests appears mainly after 2017, when the federal government adopted hostile immigration policies. By establishing and contextualizing the relationship between immigrant concentration and 311 usage, the study contributes to a deeper understanding of civic participation and the connection between immigrant communities and government.",

    "description": "AbstractPast studies have established the existence of a persistent gender gap in re-partnering, wherein women are less likely to re-partner than men in the general population. Existing theories and explanations focus on women\u2019s and men\u2019s socio-demographic characteristics as mechanisms determining their opportunities, needs, and attractiveness in the re-partnering process. However, this work assumes that people are heterosexual and overlooks sexual minorities despite growing scholarly interest in union formation and dissolution among Lesbian, Gay, and Bisexual (LGB) people. We investigate whether and how the gender gap in re-partnering intersects with sexual identity to highlight the role of gender relations as a social force that shapes union formation outcomes among both the heterosexual and LGB population. We use retrospective data on cohabitation and marriage histories from the British Understanding Society survey (UKHLS) to estimate event history models. We confirm the existence of a gender gap favoring men among heterosexuals but find that lesbian women are more likely to re-partner than gay men. We do not observe a gender gap among bisexuals. Results are robust to accounting for compositional differences between groups using exact matching techniques. These findings suggest that the persistent gender gap found in past studies is not as universal as previously presumed and that sexual identity plays a vital role in re-partnering outcomes. Therefore, sociologists should explicitly incorporate the gender relational context into models and theories that explain gender differences in union formation outcomes.",

    "description": "AbstractGender and racial pay penalties are well-known: women (of all races) and people of color (of all genders) earn less, on average, even when they gain access to occupations historically reserved for White men. Studies of social mobility show that people from working-class backgrounds in the US have also been excluded from top professional and managerial occupations. But do working-class-origin people who attain top US jobs face a class-origin pay penalty? Despite evidence of class-origin pay gaps in higher professional and managerial occupations elsewhere, we might expect that the central role of race and racism in US stratification processes, along with the relatively low salience of class identities, would render class origins irrelevant to earnings in exclusive occupations, at least within racial groups. Using the Panel Study of Income Dynamics to link childhood class position to adult occupation and earnings, we describe the racial and class-origin composition of different high-status occupations and the earnings of people within them. We show that when people who are from working-class backgrounds are upwardly mobile into high-status occupations, they earn almost $20,000 per year less, on average, than individuals who are themselves from privileged backgrounds. The difference is partly explained by the upwardly mobile being less likely to have college degrees, but it remains substantial (around $11,700) even after accounting for education, race and other important predictors of earnings. The gap is largest among White people; there is a class-origin penalty in top US occupations that is distinct from the racial pay gap.",

Yet, most studies on the gendered division of labor focus almost exclusively on changes either in work or family domain. Doing so neglects the process through which couples negotiate and contest traditional work and family responsibilities. Studies that do examine these tradeoffs have highlighted how work\u2013family strategies range far beyond simple traditional-egalitarian dichotomies but are limited to specific points in time or population subgroups. Using data from the Panel Study of Income Dynamics and latent-class analysis, this article provides the first population-based estimates of the couple-level tradeoffs inherent in work\u2013family strategies in the United States, documents trends in the share of couples who fall into each of these strategies, and considers social stratification by gender and college education in these trends. Specifically, I identify seven distinct work\u2013family strategies (traditional, neotraditional, her-second-shift, egalitarian, his-second-shift, female-breadwinner, and neither-full-time couples). Egalitarian couples experienced the fastest increase in prevalence among college-educated couples, whereas couples that lacked two full-time earners increased among less-educated couples. Still, about a quarter of all couples adopted \u201cher-second-shift\u201d strategies, with no variation across time, making it the modal work\u2013family strategy among dual-earner couples. The long-run, couple-level results support the view that the gender revolution has stalled and suggest that this stall may be caused partly by strong traditional gender preferences, whereas structural resources appear to facilitate gender equality among a selected few.",

    "description": "AbstractAll around the world, school-entry cohorts are organized on an annual calendar so that the age of students in the same cohort differs by up to one year. It is a well-established finding that this age gap entails a consequential (dis)advantage for academic performance referred to as the relative age effect (RAE). This study contributes to a recent strand of research that has turned to investigate the RAE on non-academic outcomes such as personality traits. An experimental setup is used to estimate the causal effect of monthly age on cognitive effort in a sample of 798 fifth-grade students enrolled in the Spanish educational system, characterized by strict enrolment rules. Participants performed three different real-effort tasks under three different incentive conditions: no rewards; material rewards; and material and status rewards. We observe that older students outwork their youngest peers by two-fifths of a standard deviation, but only when material rewards for performance are in place. Despite the previously reported higher taste for competition among the older students within a school-entry cohort, we do not find that the RAE on cognitive effort increases after inducing competition for peer recognition. Finally, the study also provides suggestive evidence of a larger RAE among boys and students from lower social strata. Implications for sociological research on educational inequality are discussed. To conclude, we outline policy recommendations such as implementing evaluation tools that nudge teachers toward being mindful of relative age differences.",

The compelled mobility approach emphasizes the uneven distribution of organizational and institutional resources across urban space, expecting residents of poor Black-segregated neighborhoods to exhibit non-trivial levels of everyday exposure to White, non-poor areas for resource seeking. We use two sets of location data in the hypersegregated Chicago metro to examine these two approaches: Global Positioning System (GPS) location tracking on a sample of older adults from the Chicago Health and Activity Space in Real-Time (CHART) study and travel diaries on a sample of younger adults by the Chicago Metropolitan Agency for Planning (CMAP). We introduce a novel and flexible individual-level method for assessing activity space exposures that accounts for the spatially proximate environment around home. Analyses reveal that activity space contexts mimic the racial/ethnic and socio-economic landscape of respondents\u2019 broad residential environment. However, after residential-based adjustment, Black younger (CMAP) adults from poor Black neighborhoods are disproportionately exposed to Whiter, less Black but less non-poor neighborhoods. Older (CHART) adult activity spaces align more closely with their residential areas; however, activity spaces of poor-Black-neighborhood-residing CHART Blacks are systematically poorer and, less consistently, more Black and less White after local area adjustment. Implications for understanding contextual exposures on well-being and the potential for age or cohort differences in isolation are discussed.",

    "link": "https://share.osf.io/preprint/E00D4-986-64B",
    "description": "The concept of hegemonic masculinity maintains a distinctive status within the social sciences and humanities. Yet there never has been an examination of Connell\u2019s changing conceptualization of the term throughout her scholarship, and specifically when and why she integrated \u2018legitimation\u2019 into her definition of hegemonic masculinity. The authors address this oversight by providing a detailed retrospective on the concept from its embryonic conceptualizations to its eventual reformulation. Within this historical assessment, the authors further consider Connell\u2019s broader feminist theory of gender and how legitimation of the hegemonic masculinity/emphasized femininity relationship is central to that theory. The concepts of hegemonic masculinity and emphasized femininity and the theory in which they are embedded developed in tandem over time. The paper emphasizes that during this dual development, legitimation of unequal gender relations became the theoretical linchpin for conceptualizing hegemonic masculinity and eventually its relationship to emphasized femininity as a part of Connell\u2019s larger gender theory. The paper also demonstrates that over time Connell progressively changed the meaning of hegemonic masculinity in significant ways and concludes with a discussion of recent \u2018legitimation processes\u2019 that have appeared in the literature, and how each contributes unique ways of conceptualizing the legitimation of unequal gender relations.",

    "description": "La presente disertaci\u00f3n doctoral ofrece un abordaje de la est\u00e9tica del techno. Su prop\u00f3sito principal es articular un an\u00e1lisis musicol\u00f3gico de sus caracter\u00edsticas t\u00e9cnicas y formales, una revisi\u00f3n de las categor\u00edas est\u00e9ticas que se han utilizado para comprender su experiencia y una interpretaci\u00f3n cr\u00edtica a partir del concepto de fetichismo aplicado a la m\u00fasica. Este trabajo parte de la idea de que el concepto techno no es algo un\u00edvocamente dado. Proponemos la construcci\u00f3n del mismo a partir del desarrollo de una constelaci\u00f3n de n\u00facleos tem\u00e1ticos en tensi\u00f3n. El proceder del texto, la articulaci\u00f3n entre los cap\u00edtulos y los problemas abordados, responde a la necesidad de desplegar dichas tensiones e indagar sus fundamentos. El an\u00e1lisis parte de las consecuencias formales y l\u00f3gicas temporales que implican t\u00e9cnicas como el loop y el looping, e incorpora progresivamente narrativas de ravers y categor\u00edas an\u00e1liticas de trabajos acad\u00e9micos abocados al estudio de este objeto en tanto experiencias que desbordan el \u00e1mbito meramente musicol\u00f3gico. Nuestra cr\u00edtica hilvana estas dimensiones dispares advirtiendo l\u00f3gicas en contradicci\u00f3n como son las de: linealidad y no linealidad, estatismo y movimiento; cercan\u00eda y distanciamiento; determinaci\u00f3n y abstracci\u00f3n; dominio y libertad; excitaci\u00f3n y contemplaci\u00f3n; superficialidad y profundidad; identificaci\u00f3n y encarnaci\u00f3n; trance y \u00e9xtasis; revelaci\u00f3n y fetichismo. Todas estas l\u00f3gicas contradictorias se constituyen como n\u00facleos de la constelaci\u00f3n de dilemas al interior de lo que llamamos techno. Que la cr\u00edtica al techno se presente como despliegue de las tensiones inmanentes implica tambi\u00e9n que el mismo no permanece id\u00e9ntico a s\u00ed en cada uno de los cap\u00edtulos. En este sentido, el techno ser\u00e1 pensado como g\u00e9nero musical, pero tambi\u00e9n como conjunto de t\u00e9cnicas compositivas, como forma, como temporalidad, como un tipo de escucha, como reacciones y vivencias de ravers, como forma del aparecer y, finalmente, como mercanc\u00eda fetichizada. Desafiando las interpretaciones que conciben el \u00e9xtasis del techno como una vivencia m\u00edstica \u201capol\u00edtica\u201d, no ideol\u00f3gica, de \u201cpercepci\u00f3n pura\u201d, inmediata, y de completa disoluci\u00f3n del sujeto, este trabajo propone una cr\u00edtica que expone una dimensi\u00f3n social e hist\u00f3rica en las fibras \u00edntimas de estas experiencias. Es justamente el concepto de fetichismo el que nos permite reconocer esta dimensi\u00f3n social e ideol\u00f3gica en el techno. A su vez, esta clave de lectura nos permite corroborar la vigencia de la perspectiva cr\u00edtica que representa el trabajo de Theodor. W. Adorno sobre el fetichismo y la regresi\u00f3n de la escucha. La singularidad de nuestro trabajo no consiste solamente en abordar al techno retomando aportes de la escuela de Frankfurt, sino en evitar su inmediata reducci\u00f3n a los consabidos postulados en torno al concepto de \u201cindustria cultural\u201d. Recurrir al concepto de fetichismo, por sobre el de industria cultural, permite dar lugar a una forma de cr\u00edtica que comprende el car\u00e1cter real de las intensas vivencias de cualidades m\u00edsticas, la fuerza de la apariencia y la ilusi\u00f3n de un lenguaje natural, sin mera reacci\u00f3n contingente o caprichosa de un sujeto particular. A partir del an\u00e1lisis del fetichismo, esas vivencias adquieren un car\u00e1cter objetivo como coagulaci\u00f3n social en el interior mismo de la m\u00fasica. Adem\u00e1s, este concepto nos permite contener no s\u00f3lo una dimensi\u00f3n subjetiva de las reacciones de ravers ante la m\u00fasica, sino la articulaci\u00f3n de estas con el an\u00e1lisis t\u00e9cnico y formal del techno sin caer en meras linealidades del tipo est\u00edmulo-respuesta.",

    "description": "The social acceptance of medical technology is crucial for the sustainability and effectiveness of healthcare systems, particularly in the context of demographic changes. Unlike most studies that focus on individual technologies, we measure the public perception across a range of medical technologies in a comprehensive study. We conducted an online survey with 193 participants from Germany and Bulgaria to assess perceived risk, utility, and overall attitudes (valence) toward 20 distinct medical technologies. This article presents a visual mapping of these technologies and investigates the individual and technology-related factors shaping these evaluations. Our findings suggest that perceived utility is the strongest predictor of overall attitude toward medical technology (\u03b2=0.886), with perceived risk playing a significant, albeit much smaller, role (\u03b2=-0.133). Together, these factors explain a substantial portion of the variance in overall attitudes (R^2=.959). Additionally, we found that individual differences, such as prior care experience and trust in physicians, significantly influence these perceptions. The article concludes with recommendations for effectively communicating the benefits and risks of medical technologies to the public, thereby enhancing their social acceptance and integration into healthcare systems.",

    "description": "Women are underrepresented in positions of power and leadership in higher education and the challenges faced by women in order to reach these senior positions in academia are complex and have received considerable attention in recent years. In this work, we quantify gender diversity in Brazilian academia using three types of indicators: production of knowledge, temporal evolution in the career, and training of human resources to study in detail the profile of the Deans of Research and Graduate Studies in 215 Higher Education Institutions in the year of 2019. Our analysis shows that around only 36% of positions were occupied by women, a percentage that is not consistent with the number of women professors in Brazilian higher education. Using the National Council for Scientific and Technological Development Lattes\u2019 Platform databank, we show that men and women in dean positions publish roughly the same number of paper/scientific articles per year and present almost the same time elapsed in the career path, while women produce more human resources. The fact that women occupy only 1/3 of the positions of dean of research and graduation reveals that for women to reach the top, it is necessary that they adapt to the same metric intended for men while facing additional challenges indicating a persistent glass ceiling.",

    "description": "Our work proposes to highlight the role of territorial determinants and more particularly those of socio-economic nature in the development of a territorial soy industry in the Hauts-de-France region, France. The approach consists of highlighting how and what are the conditions and the forms of the determinants of social capital to anchor a sustainable local soy industry. Thus, in our paper, these socio-economic determinants take the form of the collective dynamics of farmers which constitute a major factor in the establishment of soy culture in different territories of Hauts-de-France region. In this paper we have chosen a qualitative approach using a grid of semi-directive interviews with agricultural stakeholders, as part of the DOP Picardie project . The various players involved in the soya commodity chain were interviewed, with a comparative analysis of two study areas, Bourgogne Franche Comt\u00e9 and Marne. Our surveys and their interpretations yielded numerous results in the form of motivations, constraints, and recommendations for the sustainable establishment of soya sector in Hauts-de-France, as well as the identifying the socio-economic, agronomic, and regulatory factors that come together as collective actions to promote this sector.",

Compared to a benevolent policymaker benchmark, I show that reputational concerns can lead to suboptimal policymaking, as a result of the interdependence between voters' learning about implemented policies and their induced preferences over politicians: when favourable policy outcomes lead voters to prefer policy persistence, the desire to appear responsive can stifle the implementation of the right environmental policy.",

    "description": "Nature connection is an important leverage point for both human wellbeing and planetary health. While previous research has identified associations between nature connection and wellbeing, there has been little examination of how different wellbeing measures are associated with nature connection, and how this correlation varies by population groups. We seek to fill this gap through a survey of 4006 individuals in Australia. We find a strong association between nature connection and two measures of wellbeing: life satisfaction, and health-related quality-of-life. The association between nature connection and life satisfaction was similar to that of income and life satisfaction. The association between nature connection and wellbeing was found to be particularly strong for younger people, and those who speak a language other than English at home. Through developing a measure examining one\u2019s life satisfaction relative to their health-related quality-of-life, we find that those with higher levels of nature connection tend to have greater life satisfaction than health-related quality-of-life. These findings highlight the important role policy can play in enhancing nature connection to improve wellbeing, such as expanding green space development and providing individuals with more opportunities to meaningfully connect with nature.

    "description": "A sequence of technological inventions over several centuries has dramatically lowered the cost of producing and distributing information. Because culture and societies ride on a substrate of information, these changes have profoundly impacted how we live, work, and interact with each other. This paper explores the nature of information architectures (IAs)\u2014the features that govern how information flows within human populations. IAs include physical and digital infrastructures, norms and institutions, and algorithmic technologies for filtering, producing, and disseminating information. IAs shape everyday lives and cultural practices; they can reinforce societal biases and discriminations and lead to prosocial outcomes as well as unintended social ills. IAs have culturally evolved rapidly with human usage, creating new affordances and new problems for the dynamics of social interaction. We explore the significant societal outcomes instigated by shifts in IAs and call for an enhanced understanding of the social implications of increasing IA complexity, the nature of competition among IAs, and the creation of mechanisms for coordination to guide the beneficial use of IAs. Navigating the challenges IAs pose requires creative experimentation, novel tools, and an understanding of societal norms and institutions. Given that the speed and influence of IAs are accelerating, research in this area is increasingly imperative to ensure that the nature of IAs aligns with a collectively desirable future.",

This research investigates what is needed to lift the quality of Australian housing to align with international standards so as to address problems associated with aged and ill-performing housing stock in both the owned and rented sectors. The research explores different strategies for improving housing through voluntary programs and mandatory legislation, and found: a national strategy to improve residential building quality should be developed mandatory disclosure of dwelling energy performance could improve how markets consider the performance of houses offered for sale or lease more appropriate accounting methods of the benefits provided by improved housing standards are needed. To improve the building quality of Australian housing stock, it is important to investigate how and why governments make policy about the quality of Australian housing stock. Change is difficult because of both the challenges of getting government attention and pressure from strong property industry lobbyists, but it is not impossible. One of the sharp lessons from the case studies is that having research evidence is not enough; change needs key elements such as building a convincing narrative to tell a plausible story of a social problem (including coverage of the evidence in the popular media) together with a \u2018coalition of support\u2019. A national strategy to improve residential building quality should be developed and include the following regulatory mechanisms: improved performance standards for new houses; mandatory disclosure of dwelling energy performance; and minimum housing standards for the rental sector.",

    "description": "How do we imagine economic objects, processes, and actions? More importantly, if the future is inherently uncertain what limits the range of possible imaginings such that actors can agree and coordinate? Building on the work of Jens Beckert, I outline an approach to imagination and imaginative labor in economic sociology grounded on the insight that embodied cognition is central to the capacity for exploring possibilities for action and organizing abstract domains. To demonstrate this approach, I use examples from a field whose fictional expectations have a significant impact on the global political-economy: elite professional advisory firms. This is a field in the business of selling imaginative labor, both within the backstage work of recruiting and the frontstage work of selling.",

    "link": "https://share.osf.io/preprint/E0112-46F-E74",
    "description": "Background: The escalating hostilities with Israel that began on 7 October 2023 have intensified the already dire situation in Gaza, with power outages and severe shortages of medicines and health supplies crippling hospitals' ability to deliver life-saving care. Using Gaza as a case study, in this article we introduce the concept of \u201cjustice-orientated statistical counter-stories\u201d. Methods: We argue that traditional statistics distort reality, hide disparities, and generally misrepresent social and environmental issues. We show that by making \u201cadjustments\u201d based on identifiable flaws in raw statistical datasets we can rectify this problem and offer an alternative view. We illustrate the principles of justice-oriented statistical counter-stories by examining the aid flow to Gaza in 2023 from major OECD countries. Results: Our justice-orientated analytical lens shows how the rankings for OECD countries shift significantly when we factor in donor nations\u2019 GDP and military aid donations to Israel, who are propagating a war against the Palestinian people. Our paper also identifies some of the key methodological challenges in making such adjustments (issues of aggregated data, asymmetrical data periods and unavailable data). Conclusion: We conclude by emphasising the broader implications of \u201cjustice-orientated statistical counter-stories\u201d for understanding not only aid flows, but global development and the representation of social and environmental issues.",

    "description": "This study analyses data from the Annual Children in Need Census (2015-2023) obtained via Freedom of Information requests to examine whether there has been a shift towards a more investigative approach in handling cases involving children with disabilities or mental health concerns in England. The results show a 77.1% increase in assessments identifying these concerns, now comprising a quarter of all assessments. For children with disabilities or mental health concerns, Section 47 investigations surged by 145.2%, compared to a 45.4% rise for children without these factors. Simultaneously, the proportion of children whose primary need was classified as \"disability or illness\" dropped by 17.4%, indicating a declining focus on addressing their specific needs. The study echoes concerns from parent-led groups and prior research, suggesting that social care services are increasingly treating families of disabled children as potential risks rather than focusing on their needs, fostering \"parent carer blame.\" This trend, rooted in a risk-averse social work culture, highlights the need to reconsider current assessment practices, which may be intrusive and harmful to families seeking support. The findings call for a re-evaluation of social care policies to better address the needs of disabled children without defaulting to investigative procedures.",

    "description": "Early assessment of reading abilities is important for ensuring long-term academic and career-related success. Pre-reading assessment tools can identify children at risk of future reading difficulties. However, most bilingual children do not have access to appropriate early reading assessments. This is due to the lack of language-appropriate assessment tools. The current longitudinal study examines the predictive validity of a linguistically- and culturally-responsive Urdu Phonological Tele-Assessment (U-PASS) tool, including subtests for phonological awareness and rapid automatized naming (RAN) \u2014 commonly-assessed reading precursors. Specifically, we investigate whether kindergarten-level Urdu phonological awareness and RAN skills predict the future Grade 1 Urdu reading accuracy and fluency skills of Urdu-English bilinguals in two bilingual contexts: Pakistan (where Urdu is spoken as a national language; n = 104; Experiment 1) and Canada (where Urdu is spoken as a heritage language; n = 50; Experiment 2). Hierarchical linear regression analyses demonstrate predictive validity of the U-PASS tool across the two country contexts. Particularly, Urdu phonological awareness emerged as a consistent longitudinal predictor of Urdu word/non-word reading accuracy and fluency, while RAN was a reliable predictor of the reading fluency measures. The U-PASS tool provides access to linguistically- and culturally-responsive early pre-reading assessment, and enables researchers, speech-language pathologists, and educators to examine pre-reading skills in the heritage-language of Urdu-speaking children globally.",

    "description": "Background: When COVID-19 vaccines became available, healthcare workers (HCWs) were prioritized for vaccination. Despite debate, vaccine mandates were implemented in most healthcare settings across Canada, including Ontario, with many still in effect. Goal: This study examines Ontario HCWs' perspectives on vaccine mandates, focusing on their decision-making experiences, the mandates' impact on their lives and livelihoods, and their views on the effects of mandates on patient care. Methods: An online cross-sectional survey was conducted among Ontario HCWs of diverse vaccination status, professions, ages, socioeconomic status, races/ethnicities, and genders. Recruitment was through professional networks and snowball sampling. We performed a thematic analysis of responses to one open-ended question and to open-ended options in closed questions. Quantitative results are reported separately. Results: Out of 468 participants, 225 responded to the open-ended question, and 111 provided answers to open-ended options in closed questions. Most respondents were unvaccinated, had been terminated for non-compliance with vaccination mandates, experienced personal losses, and reported negative views on mandates and their impacts on patient care. Six themes emerged: 1) policies conflicting with scientific evidence and professional practice; 2) conflicts with medical ethics; 3) unaccounted for or dismissed personal hardships; 4) unacknowledged for or dismissed physical harms; 5) discrimination against unvaccinated individuals; and 6) negative impacts on patient care. Conclusions: The study indicates significant harm to HCWs and patients due to mandates, and advocates for the cessation of mandated vaccination in favor of evidence-based, ethical policies.",

    "description": "The idea that labor scarcity can induce economic development has been long hypothesized (Hicks, 1932; Habakkuk, 1962), but the evidence is scarce, especially on non-agricultural development. In this paper, I assess the role of the Second Great Migration (1940-1970) on the subsequent structural change in the American South between 1970 and 2010. Empirical results using shift-share instruments show that out-migration incentivized physical capital investment and capital-augmenting technical change, increasing capital and output per worker in both agriculture and manufacturing at least until 2010. Labor reallocated from agriculture to nonagriculture. I then develop and calibrate a dynamic spatial equilibrium model that allows substitution between factors of production, factor-biased technical change, and Heckscher\u2013Ohlin forces in trade. The quantitative results indicate that the adjustments to the Second Great Migration could have contributed to 7% of the total decrease in agricultural employment between 1940 and 2010 in the South. The contribution analyses suggest that labor-capital substitution played a leading role in economic adjustment to the migration, with capital-biased technical change and the quasi-Rybczynski effect playing important supplementary roles.",

    "description": "Our understanding of typical smartphone behavior has only recently begun to advance due to the accessibility of increasingly valid data sources. Beyond analysing the frequency, duration, and content of smartphone activities, there is substantial value in understanding when people engage in particular forms of mobile media use, and data collection methods that go beyond simple retrospective self-reports provide the means to do so. This paper contributes to our understanding of contemporary smartphone usage patterns and their temporal dynamics by employing a mixed-method dataset obtained through Android logging, iOS data donation, and mobile experience sampling methods. This dataset captures both the quantity and quality of smartphone use among a large, quota-targeted sample of German adults (n = 2032). The findings provide a comprehensive view of smartphone use, examining both overall trends and daily rhythms. They reveal that smartphone usage is typified by frequent, short interactions, with younger users displaying more fragmented patterns compared to older counterparts, alongside variations in the gratifications derived across age groups. These findings lay the groundwork for further theorization about the causes, nature, and consequences of the observed usage patterns, while also offering essential contextual and methodological insights for researchers employing intensive longitudinal approaches to evaluate smartphone usage.",

    "description": "Where do queer immigrants settle in the United States? The policy landscape for same-sex couples in the U.S. has changed rapidly in recent years, with immigrants being particularly affected. After the 2013 end of the Defense of Marriage Act, U.S. citizens could finally sponsor the visa of a same-sex partner, and number of immigrants in same-sex couples increased rapidly. But little is known about where these lesbian, gay, and bisexual (LGB) immigrants choose to settle and enjoy their new rights. Do they behave more similarly to their straight immigrant counterparts and locate based on job opportunities and cost of living? Or do they gravitate toward more queer-friendly cities and states, as U.S.-born LGB people do? How have these patterns changed over time, especially in response to local policy changes relevant to queer people and immigrants? Using American Community Survey data from 2008-2022 and original datasets, this paper implements descriptive analyses and quasi-Poisson models to study how settlement patterns of immigrants in same-sex couples in the U.S. respond to local and national policy changes as well as other local sociodemographic and economic factors. We find that the distribution of immigrants in same-sex couples is expanding across the U.S. over time. These settlement patterns generally look more similar to fellow U.S.-born LGB Americans: locations with higher concentrations are more progressive, have more robust LGBTQ+ civic life, and have higher incomes. Yet immigrants in same-sex couples also live in more racially and ethnically diverse areas compared to U.S.-born Americans in same-sex couples. Our findings contribute to a fuller understanding of this rapidly growing population and under which conditions they may behave more similarly to their fellow migrants, their fellow sexual minorities, or as a distinct population all their own.",

    "link": "https://share.osf.io/preprint/E00B1-443-C92",
    "description": "Differences-in-differences designs for estimating causal effects rely on an assumption of ``parallel trends\" -- that in the absence of the intervention, treated units would have followed the same outcome trajectory as observed in control units. When parallel trends fails, researchers often turn to alternative strategies that relax this identifying assumption. One popular approach is the inclusion of a group-specific linear time trend in the commonly used two-way fixed effects (TWFE) estimator. In a setting with a single post-treatment and two pre-treatment periods it is well known that this is equivalent to a non-parametric ``triple-differences\" estimator which is valid under a ``parallel trends-in-trends\" assumption (Egami and Yamauchi, 2023). This paper analyzes the TWFE estimator with group-specific linear time trends in the more general setting with many pre- and post-treatment periods. It shows that this estimator can be interpreted as an average over triple-differences terms involving both pre-treatment and post-treatment observations. As a consequence, this estimator does not identify a convex average of post-treatment ATTs without additional effect homogeneity assumptions even when there is no staggering in treatment adoption. A straightforward solution is to make the TWFE specification fully dynamic with a separate parameter for each relative treatment time. However, identification requires that researchers omit at least two pre-treatment relative treatment time indicators to estimate a group-specific linear trend. The paper shows how to properly extend this estimator to the staggered adoption setting using the approach of Sun and Abraham (2021), correcting a perfect collinearity error in recent implementations of this method in Hassell and Holbein (2024). It concludes with a note of caution for researchers, showing through a replication of Kogan (2021) how inferences from group-specific time trend specifications can be extremely sensitive to arbitrary specification choices when parallel trends violations are present but do not follow an easily observed functional form.",

Through an empirically informed agent-based model, this study provides support for the proposed theoretical pathway and shows that, when combined with empirically representative structural inequalities, this racial composition effect can help explaining the pattern of interest.

Informed by this literature, this article unpacks the necessary and sufficient conditions under which the hoarding of educational resources emerges within schools. It develops a qualitatively informed agent-based model which captures Black and White students' competition for a valuable school resource: advanced coursework. In contrast to traditional accounts --- which explain the emergence of hoarding through the actions of Whites that keep valuable resources within White communities --\u2013 simulations, perhaps surprisingly, show hoarding to arise even when Whites do not play the role of hoarders of resources. Behind this result is the fact that a structural inequality (i.e., racial differences in social class), and not action-driven hoarding, is the necessary condition for hoarding to emerge. Findings, therefore, illustrate that common action-driven understandings of opportunity hoarding can overlook the structural foundations behind this important phenomenon.

    "description": "Sociological research on careers and organizations suggests that those with a wide range of skills (generalists) are disadvantaged due to the dispersion of their competencies, whereas those with a focused expertise in a specific area (specialists) benefit from a deeper understanding of their domain. This study tests the applicability of these findings to academia, assessing whether scholars with a specialized publication output are more likely to obtain tenure than those with a more generalist output. Using a combination of computational quantitative text analysis of 5497 journal abstracts published along with longitudinal career data covering CV and publication data of sociology professors in German academia, first, we find that a generalist research focus has a positive and statistically significant effect on attaining tenure. In addition, male sociologists derive greater benefits from a generalist publication strategy, whereas female sociologists experience greater advantages from specialization. Second, we disentangle the overall effect into \u2018qualitative\u2019 and \u2018quantitative\u2019 specialization. Our results show a slight but non-significant advantage for sociologists who focus primarily on publishing quantitative research.

    "description": "With both affective polarization and populism on the rise in several countries, many have proposed a link between the two phenomena. Yet, research offers little direct evidence on whether populist individuals are more polarized. This paper aims to fill this gap by using CSES data from 37 elections in 31 countries to provide a comparative account of the relationship between populism and affective polarization at the individual level. We show that populist individuals are not more polarized than their mainstream counterparts. Instead, we identify a curvilinear relationship wherein both citizens who strongly endorse or reject populist ideas exhibit high levels of polarization, with substantial variations across countries. Furthermore, populism is associated with a general disdain for all political parties rather than just rival parties. These findings challenge the prevailing assumption that populism is asymmetrically associated with affective polarization and suggest that ideological extremism, rather than populism, may be associated with the upsurge in affective polarization observed in some Western democracies.",

    "description": "Previous studies in the Nordic context report a positive association between a stronger labor market attachment and entry into parenthood (i.e., first birth), but the association is stronger for men than for women, and it is modified by educational attainment and life-course stage. This study asks whether and how the relationship between employment status and entry into parenthood has changed for women and men born in Finland in the 1970s, 1980s, and early 1990s. We first examine how the life-course situations in which women and men make decisions on entering parenthood have changed across cohorts. We use total population register data and event history methods and compare cohorts that differ, for example, in terms of the macroeconomic conditions they encountered during their young adulthood. Our results show that employment uncertainty, measured as unemployment, has not increased across cohorts. Women and men who are (still) childless are increasingly combining studies and paid employment. The positive association between a stronger labor market attachment and entry into parenthood has remained unchanged, while a cohort trend towards delayed or foregone entry into parenthood occurs regardless of labor market status. To tackle Finland\u2019s exceptionally low fertility rates at the policy level, we emphasize the need to design policies that better target women and men in different life situations.",

    "description": "Large language models have become popular over a short period of time because they can generate text that resembles human writing across various domains and tasks. The popularity and breadth of use also put this technology in the position to fundamentally reshape how written language is perceived and evaluated. It is also the case that spoken language has long played a role in maintaining power and hegemony in society, especially through ideas of social identity and ``correct'' forms of language. But as human communication becomes even more reliant on text and writing, it is important to understand how these processes might shift and who is more likely to see their writing styles reflected back at them through modern AI. We therefore ask the following question: \\textit{who} does generative AI write like? To answer this, we compare writing style features in over 150,000 college admissions essays submitted to a large public university system and an engineering program at an elite private university with a corpus of over 25,000 essays generated with GPT-3.5 and GPT-4 to the same writing prompts. We find that human-authored essays exhibit more variability across various individual writing style features (e.g., verb usage) than AI-generated essays. Overall, we find that the AI-generated essays are most similar to essays authored by students who are males with higher levels of social privilege. These findings demonstrate critical misalignments between human and AI authorship characteristics, which may affect the evaluation of writing and calls for research on control strategies to improve alignment.",

This paper considers the technology transition to the automobile in the early 20th C and the discursive and cultural power that states are typically considered to wield through their information collection and management activities. It compares the situation in places where the state was heavily involved in coordinating the technology transition through its information practices, and the situation in the US, where the state was an extreme outlier for its lack of involvement in the same processes. Results suggest that the state ought not to be seen as wielding power in this case, despite the clear importance of the state to the historical narrative in other countries, as the same outcomes were accomplished in the American case even without state involvement. This suggests that research may collectively overstate the in4luence that conventionally powerful actors wield through discourse and culture, and further suggests that states play a more subdued role during technology transitions than what is currently assumed in the literature.",

This paper explores the potential of international norm-making for scaling up the governance of digital technologies and infrastructures, which have trans- and supra-national effects but are currently only governed within national jurisdictions. We chart the international neoliberal consensus currently being formalised, which affirms that data is primarly an economic commodity and must be treated according to free-market principles. We argue that this is inadequate because it cannot address interests beyond the commercial, namely data\u2019s connections to bodies, land, community and labour. We then explore the history of norm-making and offer two assertions: first, that a norm-making lens can frame challenges to the primacy of market logics in law and governance, and second, that the conceptual exclusion of civil society actors as norm-makers is an obstacle to the recognition of counter-power in data governance.

    "link": "https://share.osf.io/preprint/E0030-814-797",
    "description": "Misinformation has become a critical challenge for organizations and societies, threatening to disrupt key social, economic and public health goals. With the pervasiveness of social media, and the advent of novel AI technologies, the scale and complexity of misinformation has reached unprecedented levels. Consequently, an important focus of social science research in this area has been to understand why individuals are susceptible to consuming and sharing misinformation online, and what can be done to mitigate its adverse effects. In this study, we re-examine and synthesize key findings on the psychological, social and technological drivers of misinformation from the past decade to emphasize important gaps and avenues for future research on the topic. Based on our integrative review, we highlight four important directions for researchers and policy makers to consider. First, it will be useful to expand the definition of misinformation beyond notions of information quality and facticity, and incorporate its potential for manipulation and harm. Second, there is an urgent need to invest in more causal studies that can establish (or falsify) the harmful impacts of online misinformation in critical domains such as politics, health and marketing. Third, we need to better understand non-cognitive and motivational pathways of misinformation spread i.e., how/why misinformation proliferates as a result of social processes, both at an interpersonal (e.g., due to self-presentational motives) and societal level (e.g., due to declining trust in mainstream institutions, and increasing social polarization). Lastly, future studies should reinvestigate current findings in the context of emerging digital populations and platforms that currently remain understudied. Drawing on these findings, we highlight key areas for improving policies and technologies to mitigate the potential harms of misinformation.",

Seventy-two respondents whose attitudes toward authenticity were classified as realists, constructivists, and postmodernists watched a video about the Hobbiton Movie Set, a staged attraction in Rotorua, New Zealand. Heartbeat data was converted into three measures of heart rate variability: time-domain, frequency-domain, and qualitative non-linear measure. Heart rate variability differed among authenticity groups. People with realist attitudes stayed more focused and had lower HRV. Postmodernists were the most likely to accept the staged attraction as authentic and their kind of place to visit. Promotional materials generating positive arousal contributed to positive authentication.",

    "description": "This article addresses the controversial topic of public resistance to immigration, focusing on the role that occupations play and how they can shape cultural responses against immigrants. In particular, the study focuses on occupation-specific skills (OSS), which are assets whose returns depend on the occupational labor market context. When occupational unemployment is low relative to job vacancies, OSS protect against labor market competition, but their effectiveness decreases when unemployment increases. As a result, occupations with high OSS, such as professionals and managers, are particularly affected when the occupational labor market deteriorates. The paper claims that this deterioration in labor market prospects leads to a decline in the perception of social status, which in turn results in a cultural reaction against immigration. The paper fills the gap in the literature about why high-skilled workers may react culturally against outgroups. The results of several attitudinal surveys, including longitudinal data, support this argument.",

    "description": "Today, fast fashion is experiencing rapid growth, increasingly overshadowing ethical shopping practices. Even consumers with strong sustainability awareness find it increasingly challenging to align their ethical principles with their shopping behavior due to the overwhelming availability of fast fashion products. This study aims to deepen the understanding of consumer exposure to fast fashion by synthesizing existing analytical methods with data on the sustainability practices of fast fashion companies. We conducted an online survey with items assigned to predefined factors, calculated the sustainability performance of selected fast fashion companies, and integrated this information into the survey results. We then grouped items per factor using cluster analysis and investigated the strengths and directions of the relationships between factors and the identified clusters through descriptive analysis. The results indicate that respondents' shopping patterns, along with their opinions on the sustainability of selected fast fashion companies, have a discernible effect on their shopping behavior. A gap between consumers' attitudes and behavior was observed; however, the results also show positive tendencies, with consumers who have strong sustainability attitudes making up the largest share among those with strong sustainable shopping behavior. Notably, female respondents displayed a much more pronounced sustainable attitude. Generation Y exhibited a stronger environmental attitude toward shopping, as well as more pronounced sustainable shopping behavior, compared to Generation Z. No significant difference in shopping behavior between consumers from urban and non-urban areas was detected. This study links relevant attitudinal and behavioral information to the sustainability practices of fast fashion companies through sampling and unsupervised analysis methods, marking a further step toward understanding consumers' exposure to fast fashion consumption and the potential barriers influencing the discrepancy between purchasing attitudes and behavior.",

The results of our study show how these perceptions of legitimacy of the EU and national executives that are expressed in the letters to the editor were debated differently in the two crises studied. Additionally, we find that there was a clear focus on the national executive during the pandemic. Furthermore, the crises provide a public opportunity to criticise how the political system works, thus contesting the legitimacy of EU or national polity extending beyond concrete policy measures.",

    "description": "The inherent \"take-make-waste\" of the current linear economy is a major contributor to exceeding planetary boundaries. The transition to a circular economy (CE) and the associated challenges and opportunities requires fast, innovative solutions. Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML) are poised to play a pivotal role in facilitating this transition by addressing the challenges of increasing material extraction and use, ultimately contributing to a more environmentally sustainable future. This article aims to provide an overview of the current state of AI and ML in the transition to CE and to discuss their potential and associated challenges. A literature survey conducted on Google Scholar, using targeted queries with predefined keywords and search operators, revealed that the number of experimental scientific contributions related to AI and ML in CE has grown significantly in recent years. As the volume of research articles has increased, so has the diversity of ML methods and algorithms featured in experimental CE publications. Furthermore, we found that since 2020, there has been an 84% increase in AI and ML-related research articles on CE in Google Scholar, compared to the total number of such entries, and a 55% increase in articles since 2023, compared to those published up to 2023. The current state of scientific contributions indicates that AI and ML are increasingly recognized as valuable tools for advancing the CE, and their application continues to grow steadily.",

Previous research faced empirical challenges with causal inference, limited sample sizes, and limited outcomes. I marshal data from 14 panel surveys from 1956 to 2022 with 48,629 respondents to help better understand the causal effects of union membership. In these data, I use difference-in-difference designs to evaluate whether gaining union membership causes voters to liberalize their attitudes and participate in politics. I do not find any evidence that union membership affects political behavior, and I show that we can reject modest effects in most cases. I also show that a prominent previous result is not robust. These results suggest a reconsideration of how labor unions influence politics.",

However, these barriers remain underexplored, particularly in fossil-fuel-rich countries such as Iran. This study examined women's opinions on barriers to implementing renewable energy in daily activities through semi-structured interviews. The interviewees were women residing in Tehran, and the number of interviews was determined based on the \"purposive sampling\" and \"theoretical sampling\" methods. Collecting data continued until no new features and concepts emerged. Employing grounded theory, we developed a model categorizing women\u2019s views into causal conditions (e.g., energy definitions, consumption behavior, renewable energy applications, global warming), context conditions (e.g., energy value, policy, accessibility, infrastructure), and intervening conditions (e.g., indigenous knowledge, motivation).

However, various barriers limit their participation, highlighting the need for targeted public policies. The study also identified gaps in achieving SDGs 5 (Gender Equality), 7 (Affordable & Clean Energy), 11 (Sustainable Cities & Communities), 12 (Responsible Consumption & Production), and 13 (Climate Action).

    "description": "Despite longstanding scholarly interest in migrant academic achievement, there has been little work to isolate an effect of migrating on student outcomes. This paper harnesses a causal inference framework to evaluate the effect of migration on young people's learning outcomes on a global scale. Using test score data from the 2012, 2015, and 2018 Programme for Student Assessment, it compares 8,726 migrants in 42 destination countries to 603,280 counterparts in 55 countries of origin. After adjustment for individual characteristics using Generalized Random Forests and Augmented Inverse Probability Weighting, multilevel techniques developed for meta-analysis aggregate effect estimates for each country pair and test the effects of country-level mediators. Generally, migrant students obtain slightly lower scores on these exams than similar stay-at-homes in their countries of origin, but results vary greatly by countries. Children who migrate to wealthier and more democratic countries tend to outperform stay-at-homes, and there is partial evidence that between-school tracking is associated with lower scores relative to stay-at-homes. In addition, children who migrate at older ages and who have two rather than one migrant parent tend to score lower.",

    "description": "Research on parasocial phenomena is thriving, and parasocial processing emerged as a key concept in the wake of this trend. The PSI-Process Scales (Schramm & Hartmann, 2008) initially provided a comprehensive tool for assessing parasocial processing, quickly becoming a widely used measure in the field. However, the scale\u2019s extensive length has posed challenges for consistent and full application, often resulting in ad-hoc modifications. To address these limitations, this study derives and systematically tests a shortened version of the PSI-Process Scales, termed the Parasocial Processing Short Scale (PP-SS). The theoretically grounded scale consists of only 9 items \u2013 3 per cognitive, affective, and behavioral parasocial processing. The scale is systematically developed and validated in two preregistered empirical studies, including a one-factorial experiment (n = 258) and a larger survey study (n = 720) that feature a range of different personae and diverse samples. Both studies confirm the PP-SS\u2019 good psychometric quality and validity within the concept\u2019s nomological network, as well as the scale\u2019s invariance across different user groups and personae.

    "description": "Procedural justice theory states that when police treat people in a fair, respectful, and neutral manner, individuals are more likely to perceive the police as legitimate and obey the law. To test this perspective, researchers often use experimental vignettes that depict police-citizen interactions and measure subsequent attitudes. However, it is not straightforward to determine causal effects from these designs, as one must carefully assess whether the effect runs through the intended theoretical pathways in order to properly test the theory. This paper advances beyond \u2018traditional\u2019 experimental designs to evaluate the pathways linking police-citizen interactions, attitudes, and behavioral intentions. The data consist of a representative sample of 2,003 adults residing in the United States using an online panel. We use a mixed methods approach combining a pre-registered 3x2x2 experimental vignette depicting a traffic stop by police with follow-up closed- and open-ended questions, allowing respondents to explain their reasoning. We found that the quality of treatment by police was statistically related to subsequent perceptions of police legitimacy, but not compliance. However, follow-up placebo tests and open-text responses revealed a number of confounding factors limiting the strength of causal claims regarding procedural justice theory. Most notably, a number of respondents expressed that they would comply with the officer in the moment, even if they disagree, out of fear of escalation and their own personal safety. Research using (quasi-)experimental designs should evaluate causal assumptions and mechanisms more rigorously when theory testing, and likewise incorporate methods that can better assess these intermediate processes, such as open text responses and process tracing.",

    "description": "In academia, a major field of knowledge production, the quality of interactions among coworkers plays a critical role. Negative ties, such as conflicts or avoidance between researchers, can impede the progress of research projects, and adversely affect individual career advancement. Our study reveals that in the academic sector, these negative relations are not \"gender-neutral\" as they are experienced 47% more often by women. Using a large representative survey linked to official scientometric records from Hungary, we demonstrate that the conditions under which women and men experience these negative relations differ. Women experience more conflicts if they act as brokers in scientific collaborations, and fewer conflicts when they are members of cohesive groups. These factors, however, do not influence the number of conflicts for men. Thus, we can argue, that while being in a broker position holds the promise for scientific success, it comes with the price of more workplace conflicts for women. Regarding the role of gender diversity and cross-gender collaboration, we find that women report less negative relations when they collaborate with fellow women if they are a small minority, but in diverse fields, cross-gender collaboration comes with fewer conflicts.",

It addresses gaps in HPT research by (a) linking HPT to theories and research from the social science disciplines on perspective taking and the self, and (b) proposing a way to analyze how different tasks may elicit different kinds of HPT. The framework is grounded in a study where four young adults thought aloud while taking the perspective of a victim or a perpetrator at the Salem Witch Trials and a Holocaust-era massacre. Four shifting \u201cself perspectives\u201d were identified, whereby participants thought as their present-day selves, constructed hypothetical and imagined past selves, and made timeless generalizations about humans. To demonstrate the utility of the framework, it is then used to consider how task characteristics may elicit differential use of the self perspectives. It is argued that close attention to these self perspectives is a novel and crucial way to bring nuance to the concept of HPT, and implications for multiple learning environments are discussed.",

With the increasing integration of GAI in everyday tasks, its potential to transform the learning experience has gained significant attention. However, concerns have been raised relating to the use of GAI as a threat to academic integrity, the lack of accuracy of its outputs, and its potential influence on critical engagement in learning. While HE institutions in the UK have warned against the unregulated use of AI-generated content, the prevailing approach is to guide students in the ethical and transparent use of GAI tools. This research, based on primary data from a questionnaire involving undergraduate and postgraduate students across several UK HE institutions, aims to explore student perspectives on issues such as plagiarism, reliability, and the impact of GAI on the learning process. The findings show that students who identify as men report a higher frequency of GAI usage than women and that international students have more liberal standards regarding academic integrity compared to their UK counterparts.",

    "link": "https://share.osf.io/preprint/E020B-1E6-215",
    "description": "Adverse life events are often understood as having negative consequences for mental health via objective hardships, which are worse for persons with less income. But adversity can also affect mental health via more subjective mechanisms, and here, it is possible that persons with higher income will exhibit greater psychological sensitivity to negative events, for various reasons. This article theorizes potential mechanisms of increasing sensitivity with income. The proposition is tested using the strategic case of spousal and parental bereavement among older US adults. The analyses find consistent evidence of increasing sensitivity of depressive symptoms with income. A series of robustness checks indicate that findings are not due to endogenous or antecedent selection. Further, exploratory analyses of mechanisms suggest that higher sensitivity among the affluent was driven by greater expectations and better relationship quality with the deceased. These findings problematize the conceptualization and assessment of human suffering in economically stratified societies.",

    "description": "The professionalisation of policing in the UK has evolved significantly, especially since 2012, with structural changes like the establishment of the College of Policing and the introduction of Police and Crime Commissioners. This paper explores the role of critical thinking in UK police public order training and its potential to enhance police professionalism. It examines professionalism through sociological frameworks, aligning the National Decision Model (NDM) used in police training with academic models such as Burch\u2019s Learning Stages of Competence and Leicester\u2019s Four Habits of Thought. The paper argues that embedding critical thinking within public order training enhances ethical decision making, problem solving, and adaptability, thereby reinforcing professional standards. It also considers the impact of recent changes in police entry routes, including a non degree pathway, on the ongoing professionalisation of the police service. Ultimately, the integration of critical thinking into training is deemed essential for advancing UK policing's professionalisation.",

    "description": "This paper investigates the interplay between fields, markets, and movements in the emergence and development of new cultural categories. While some scholars argue that the rise of new genres is driven by internal resource mobilization, others contend that external market and field environments can both constrain and enable their emergence and growth. Through a cross-national comparative study of electronic/dance music and its various genres from 1985 to 2005, we demonstrate that genre emergence and development are significantly influenced by their embeddedness in different field environments: the environment of proximate genres, the mainstream music market and the transnational field level. The impact of these field environments on the emergence and development of dance genres, however, varies by country. Notably, markets and movements are more strongly coupled in the UK and the Netherlands compared to the US. In both European countries, the mainstream success of genres drives their development through a mechanism of differentiation, leading to the creation of new and distinct genres as a reaction against increased visibility in the charts. These findings highlight multiple ways in which markets and genre movements can interact, enriching our understanding of how new cultural categories emerge.",

    "description": "Objective: This study explores educational heterogeneity in direct workplace peer effects on fathers\u2019 parental leave usage over time, aiming to understand which fathers in which contexts are influenced by their peers. Background: Family policies increasingly encourage fathers to take parental leave to boost maternal employment and paternal childcare involvement. Yet many fathers use less than their entitlement. Limited studies suggest workplace peers may encourage fathers to use (more) leave, but the evidence is mixed, leaving uncertainty about who is influenced and when. Method: This study utilizes Finnish full-population administrative registers and linked employer-employee data on fathers\u2019 leave uptake in 2009\u20132019, covering 124,953 births. Structural causal models and Bayesian multilevel logistic regression are used to investigate how preceding fathers\u2019 leave usage influences new fathers, and how the probability varies by education level, calendar time, and previous leave use in the workplace. Results: Findings indicate that peers\u2019 leave usage positively influences new fathers, with low-educated fathers more impacted by peers than highly educated fathers. Direct peer effects were strongest in workplaces with low prior leave uptake and diminished in high-uptake contexts, especially for skilled men. Conclusions: Workplace peer effects are a significant mechanism behind increasing leave uptake between policy reforms. In contexts with little information on leave consequences, workplace peers serve as important sources of information, but the information gain diminishes rapidly with increasing uptake. Learning from peers\u2019 experiences appears to be particularly important for low-educated men.",

    "description": "Recent evidence shows a considerable potential for individuals to intervene, their widespread willingness to do so but also sizeable barriers they face to reduce their environmental footprint.

Using a multi-level latent variable framework, we model the association between attitudes and a diverse range of environmentally significant actions and scale up the analysis to a cross-country setting using the 2017 wave of the Eurobarometer data. We find a moderate, positive association which holds beyond standard sociodemographic and country-level controls and exhibits an additive effect: higher attitudinal levels align with higher numbers of undertaken actions, including difficult, costly and high-impact ones. The attitudes-actions association is contingent on a country's economic affluence and individual socioeconomic status. This, we argue, is evidence of the limits of mitigation strategies which focus exclusively on attitudes-driven behavioral change without consideration for the influence of sociodemographic and country-level inequalities.",

To date, there has been no systematic synthesis of the extent to which Open Science reaches these aims. We use the PRISMA scoping review methodology to partially address this gap, scoping evidence on the academic (but not societal or economic) impacts of OS. We identify 489 studies related to all aspects of OS, including Open Access (OA), Open/FAIR Data (OFD), Open Code/Software, Open Evaluation, and Citizen Science (CS). Analysing and synthesising findings, we show that the majority of studies investigated effects of OA, CS, and OFD. Key areas of impact studied are citations, quality, efficiency, equity, reuse, ethics, and reproducibility, with most studies reporting positive or at least mixed impacts. However, we also identified significant unintended negative impacts, especially those regarding equity, diversity and inclusion. Overall, the main barrier to academic impact of OS is lack of skills, resources, and infrastructure to effectively reuse and build on existing research. Building on this synthesis we identify gaps within this literature and draw implications for future research and policy.",

    "description": "What does it imply to digitalise a state, who stands to benefit and at the expense of whom? Zooming in on the digital Danish state, what if digitalisation made life easier and effortless for cisgender people while making life more difficult and hostile for trans people by hindering their liveability and citizenship through deleting their medical journals, inviting them for the wrong medical tests, blocking them from their bank accounts, denying them access to digital state welfare services and digitally excluding their identities? Despite these ramifications for trans people, existing scholarship only meagerly analyses the complex entangled relationship between transness, colonial and cisnormative legacies, algorithmic systems and nation states with none of them investigating and mapping the digital case of Denmark. In this paper, I assess the state of algorithmic violence and trans (un)liveability underlying and produced by the digitalisation of Denmark, where I argue that Denmark acts as a state extension of algorithmic violence that forces trans people to exist in a precarious state of digital and material unliveability. Based on this, I present three aspects of my preliminary findings which include (1) Healthcare: Digital medical erasure, (2) Bank & Payments: Digital blocking, and (3) MitID & Data: Digital exclusion and glitches, that uncover the concerningly violent, oppressive and ominous conditions of living for trans people in digital Denmark.",

    "description": "This comment aims to clarify trends in the percentage of men in the United States who are childfree (i.e., do not have and do not want children). Bozick (2023) used data from the National Survey of Family Growth (NSFG) to examine trends in the percentage of men who are childfree during the first two decades of the 2000s, concluding that there was a considerable increase. However, these percentages were computed incorrectly. Data from the NSFG are re-analyzed, ensuring comparable sample universes by age, correctly applying sampling weights, and including data from 2002. Following a small decline between 2006 and 2015 (10.7%-12.1%), the percent of men who were childfree between 2015 and 2019 (14.2%-15.7%) returned to the levels observed in 2002 (14.3%). Bozick's (2023) original conclusion, that the percentage of men who are childfree has grown considerably, is inconsistent with these revised analyses. Childfree men, and childfree adults in general, are a large and understudied demographic group that warrants greater attention, but researchers should exercise caution when studying trends in childfree prevalence.",

Common explanations for the rise of these monopolies include external network effects, economies of scale, technological barriers to entry, user lock-in, and inadequate antitrust regulation. While these explanations may accurately describe the current situation, they are insufficient to fully explain the emergence of digital monopolies. This article presents an alternative historical-institutional perspective, arguing that the specific history of the Internet and the initial reluctance of Internet users to pay for services fundamentally shaped market conditions and made network externalities a central factor. From a historical-institutional perspective, it becomes clear that the specific course of change - including the multi-sidedness of digital platforms and the increasing decoupling of use and exchange values - is largely due to these initial market exchange conditions.",

    "description": "The relief of responsibility is a cornerstone that shapes capitalist market societies and manifests itself in three central aspects of this economic order: free wage labor, limited liability corporations, and market exchange. Free wage labor is a defining feature of capitalism, in which human labor is exchanged for monetary compensation. However, historical evidence shows that employers have often neglected their responsibilities to their workers, subjecting them to harsh and deplorable working conditions. This has led to government intervention in the form of legislation and social safety nets, effectively transferring responsibility to the state. Limited liability companies offer shareholders protection from personal liability, even in the event of corporate malfeasance. This allows for rapid capital expansion and economic growth in capitalist market economies, but it also shifts the burden of associated risk to society as a whole. Market exchange, characterized by bilateral transactions for mutual benefit, generates externalities that affect third parties. Examples include the consequences of environmental degradation and social inequality resulting from market exchange. In capitalist market societies, the relief of responsibility has a pervasive influence. It is important to be aware of this fundamental principle and its implications so that we can work to create a more just and equitable society.",

I argue that relying solely on parental education as a proxy for parents\u2019 skills provides an incomplete view of their human capital and may underestimate their role in social reproduction. Parents enhance their human capital through on-the-job learning, with occupation-specific expertise becoming integral to their skill sets. Using longitudinal family data (NLSY79-CYA) and the O*NET dataset, I employ two-way fixed effects, inverse probability weighting, and asymmetric fixed effects models. I exploit changes in mothers' occupation-specific skills when they switch jobs. Results indicate that when mothers transition to roles requiring more mathematical skills, their children\u2019s mathematical abilities improve. Similar trends are observed in literacy skills, although the effects are less consistently robust. Additionally, longer maternal job tenure amplifies these effects, which are primarily driven by increases in skills rather than decreases.

The results indicate that this educational reform reduced the influence of genetic factors on life chances. Moreover, individuals with a lower genetic predisposition to education particularly benefited from the reform.

    "description": "Over the past decade, social scientists have adapted computational methods for qualitative text analysis, with the hope that they can match the accuracy and reliability of hand coding. Traditional computational techniques require extensive pre-processing of text, stripping words of context to convert them into numerical inputs for algorithms not typically designed for text. The emergence of GPT and open-source generative Large Language Models (LLMs) has transformed this process by shifting from programming to engaging with models using natural language, potentially mimicking the in-depth, inductive and/or iterative process of qualitative analysis. In this paper, we test the ability of generative LLMs to replicate and augment traditional qualitative coding, experimenting with multiple prompt structures across four LLMs. We find that LLMs can perform nearly as well as supervised machine learning models in accurately matching hand-coding output. Moreover, using generative LLMs as a natural language interlocutor closely replicates traditional qualitative methods, indicating their potential to transform the qualitative research process, despite ongoing challenges.",

We find that HCV households at the nation-scale have been consistently more highly distributed among lower-Area Median Income (AMI) census tracts and racially or ethnically concentrated areas of poverty (RECAPs). We specifically consider the potential of affirmatively furthering fair housing within the HCV program to simultaneously boost overall distributions in higher-AMI census tracts and to decrease RECAP concentrations of HCV households, observing that targeted deployment of mobility-based interventions can significantly decrease the proportion of HCV households residing in RECAPs. We further consider the impact of small area fair market rents (SAFMRs) and state-level source-of-income protections on HCV household distributions, finding that both interventions may boost HCV households into higher-AMI census tracts.",

In light of the state of research on the relationship between financialization, democracy, and social conditions, it appears plausible that the processes of financialization, which contributed to the emergence of a crisis, were influenced by the financial crisis but not completely reversed. The changes in financial market regulation, which were implemented in response to the crisis, did not create pressure for a redesign of the financial system. Therefore, one cannot deduce a significant turning point in financial market regulation from the reform measures taken. However, there are clear indications that the financial crisis has had a lasting impact on the European integration process, trust in democracy, and the political culture. Accordingly, the financial crisis can be seen as a turning point in history, primarily due to its effects on social areas beyond the financial system.",

    "description": "While politicians often argue that economic sanctions can induce policy changes in targeted states by undermining elite and public support for the reigning government, the efficacy of these measures, particularly against non-democratic regimes, is debatable. We propose that, counterintuitively, economic sanctions can bolster rather than diminish support for the sanctioned government, even in non-democratic contexts. However, this support shift and its magnitude can differ across various political factions and depend on the nature of the sanctions. To empirically evaluate our theoretical expectations, we use supervised machine learning to scrutinize nearly 2 million tweets from over 1,000 Iranian influencers, assessing their responses to both comprehensive and targeted sanctions during Donald Trump\u2019s presidency. Our analysis shows that comprehensive sanctions generally improved sentiments toward the Iranian government, even among its moderate oppositions, rendering them more aligned with the state's stance. Conversely, while targeted sanctions elicited a milder rally-around-the-flag response, the identity of the targeted entity plays a crucial role in determining the scale of this reaction.",

Quality appraisal of scientific-based policy recommendations is crucial, whether within the context of a systematic review or not. The ECR-P (Evidence Communication Rules for Policy) critical appraisal tool is used to assess the quality of both the recommendations and their evidence base putting policymakers, as the end users, centre stage. This tool was developed by a diverse group of researchers and stakeholders, taking into account existing critical appraisal tools. ECR-P is structured in five domains, based on the five rules of evidence communication. The domains include 25 signalling questions addressing aspects of internal and external validity as well as quality of communication. Domain-based judgment is derived from responses to the signalling questions and an accompanying algorithm, followed by overall quality judgement. ECR-P provides a focused, standardized and transparent approach to assessing the quality of scientific-based policy recommendations in any scientific field. ECR-P critical appraisal tool was designed to fit with the systematic reviewing process but also as a stand-alone tool.

    "link": "https://share.osf.io/preprint/E0008-F6C-898",
    "description": "Wealth is a key dimension of socioeconomic status (SES) and its intergenerational transmission, with parental wealth positively affecting children's educational outcomes. Previous research, however, has been limited to a small number of countries, and effect sizes that are hardly comparable across institutional contexts. Furthermore, the specific role of different wealth components remain unclear. This study addresses these gaps by comparing wealth gaps in education \u2013 measured as enrolment in post-secondary education \u2013 and examining the role of various wealth components across 15 European countries using harmonized data from the Household Finance and Consumption Survey. We find significant wealth gaps in education in all countries. In 10 countries, these gaps remain after controlling for other dimensions of parental SES. Regarding net wealth, our study documents substantial education gaps in Southern and Eastern European and smaller gaps in most Continental countries. In most countries, real wealth is the primary driver of these educational disparities. Conversely, the association between debt and post-secondary enrolment varies from positive to negative across countries. Our findings highlight the importance of parental real assets for education and the ambivalent and context specific role of debt.",

    "description": "Depending on the measures, methods, and sample applied, estimated contributions of genetic and environmental factors to individual differences in SES vary substantially. In the current study we use register based measures of educational attainment, occupational prestige, income, and wealth, across four genotype and family-based heritability methods in the same population-wide sample consisting of >170,000 Norwegian parents aged 35-45. Education consistently had the highest heritability, followed by occupational prestige. Shared environmental contributions were particularly strong for educational attainment and wealth. The \u2018missing heritability\u2019 was prevalent between family- and individual-based designs. Multivariate covariance analysis revealed commonality in genetic and familial environmental factors, but not in individual-specific factors. As we minimize differences in estimates due to measurement error and sample characteristics, our study is a reliable and valid source for comparing methods and indicators and for assessing the commonality between genetic and environmental factors influencing individual differences in SES.",

    "description": "The origin of modern financial economics can be traced to early discounted expected value solutions for the price of life annuities. In contrast to the single life annuity valuations attributed to de Witt and Halley, the computational complexity of joint life annuity valuation posed difficulties. Following a brief review of various joint life annuity specifications, a history of joint life annuity issuance and valuation in northern Europe from the 13th to the mid-18th century is provided. With this background, the 1671 correspondence from de Witt to Hudde on possible methods for valuing joint life annuities is detailed. These methods are contrasted with the geometric method described in Halley (1693); providing impetus for examination of the analytical approximations developed by de Moivre and Simpson.",

    "description": "This paper examines the writings of socialist scholars who played a pivotal role in shaping Hayek\u2019s perspective in TRTS, including William Beveridge, Stuart Chase, Henry Dickinson, Hugh Dalton, Evan Durbin, Oskar Lange, Harold Laski, Abba Lerner, Barbara Wootton, and the contributing authors in Findlay Mackenzie\u2019s Planned Society (1937). Many of these socialist thinkers held two main hypotheses. First, industrial concentration was inevitable under capitalism. Second, they argued that government ownership or control of key economic sectors was necessary to protect democracy from industrial consolidation in the capitalist system and to reduce political opposition to complete state ownership or control over the means of production. Despite sharing Hayek\u2019s concern for socialism\u2019s potential erosion of democratic freedoms, these socialist hypotheses have received much less scholarly attention than Hayek\u2019s TRTS. We conclude that Hayek formalized socialist scholars\u2019 fears and developed a well-defined hypothesis that central planning could threaten democratic freedoms.",

    "description": "Measurements of political polarization online have so far been largely focused on visible traces accessible through platformAPIs,while neglecting invisible traces not recorded or otherwise unavailable via online channels, which can reveal key aspects of political engagement online. Our study aims to address this gap by investigating the polarization measurement bias that arises when only visible engagement is considered. Using a combined dataset that links survey responses with YouTube digital traces froma representative sample of Hungarian Internet users (N=758), we uncover disparities at both user and channel levels. We find that users who visibly engage through commenting are more politically polarized. People tend to comment and subscribe to ideologically concentrated content, while viewing ideologically diverse content. We also notice that ideologically heterogeneous channels are more likely to share viewers than subscribers or commenters. Thus, the segregation of political channels may be overstated or simplified when relying solely on public comment data. Our results suggest that research using only visible engagement may overestimate the extent of polarization and the prevalence of echo chambers online. We highlight the benefits of data donation to address measurement bias in online political communication, and contribute to the polarization literature by providing a fresh evaluation of potential biases in platform-focused research.",

    "link": "https://share.osf.io/preprint/E0060-C0E-324",
    "description": "This paper applies complex systems theory to examine generative artificial intelligence (AI) as a contemporary wicked problem. Generative AI technologies, which autonomously create content like images and text, intersect with societal domains such as ethics, economics, and governance, exhibiting complex interdependencies and emergent behaviors. Using methodologies like network analysis and agent-based modeling, the paper maps these interactions and explores potential interventions. A mathematical model is developed to simulate the dynamics between key components of the AI-society system, including AI development, economic concentration, labor markets, regulatory frameworks, public trust, ethical implementation, global competition, and distributed AI ecosystems. The model demonstrates non-linear dynamics, feedback loops, and sensitivity to initial conditions characteristic of complex systems. By simulating various interventions, the study provides insights into strategies for steering AI development towards more positive societal outcomes. These include strengthening regulatory frameworks, enhancing ethical implementation, and promoting distributed AI ecosystems. The paper advocates for using this complex systems framework to inform inclusive policy and regulatory strategies that balance innovation with societal well-being. It concludes that embracing complexity enables stakeholders to better navigate the evolving challenges of generative AI, fostering more sustainable and equitable technological advancements.",

    "description": "Artificial intelligence (Al) tools have brought a shift and transformation in various sectors including education by providing innovative solutions to enhance learning experiences. One such Al tool that has gained significant attention is ChatGPT (Generative Pre-trained Transformer) for its ability to generate realistic texts based on user prompts. The integration of artificial intelligence (Al) tools like ChatGPT into education settings has revolutionized the learning process for students in higher education. ChatGPT, developed by OpenAl, is an Al-driven conversational model that generates human-like responses. This research delves into the factors that influence students to use ChatGPT for academic purposes and explores the multifaceted impacts it brings to the academic environment. By incorporating students\u2019 perspectives, this study identifies 6 factors encouraging the use of ChatGPT for academic purposes to students. Additionally, it seeks to assess Knowledge, Attitude, and Behavior (KAB) of students on the use of ChatGPT. The research methodology involved is qualitative approach where by document review, interviews were employed, focus group discussions, and observation. This research concludes that ChatGPT should remain being a sub tool for assisting students to advance their learning and not being an official tool for completing every work they are assigned at colleges otherwise students will graduate with low ability in generating their own ideas. The results suggest that Academic Institutions should emphasize the importance of critical thinking skills through various exercises and assignments that require students to analyze, evaluate, and solve problems independently. By encouraging critical thinking, students can develop their cognitive abilities beyond what AI tools like ChatGPT can provide.",

    "description": "The COVID\u201019 pandemic has impacted population movement around the world. Existing work has focused on countries of the Global North and restricted to the immediate effects of COVID-19 data during 2020. Data have represented a major limitation to monitor change in mobility patterns in countries in Latin American countries. Drawing on aggregate anonymised mobile phone location data from Meta\u2010Facebook users, we aim to analyse the extent and persistence of changes in the levels (or intensity) and spatial patterns of internal population movement across the rural-urban continuum in Argentina, Chile and Mexico over a 26-month period from March 2020 to May 2022. We reveal an overall systematic decline in the level of short- and long-distance movement during the enactment of nonpharmaceutical interventions in 2020, with the largest reductions occurred in the most dense areas. We also show that these levels bounced back closer to pre-pandemic levels in 2022 following the relaxation of COVID-19 stringency measures. However, the intensity of these movements has remained below pre-pandemic levels in many areas in 2022. Additionally our findings lend some support to the idea of an urban exodus. They reveal a continuing negative net balances of short-distance movements in the most dense areas of capital cities in Argentina and Mexico, reflecting a pattern of suburbanisation. Chile displays limited changes in the net balance of short-distance movements but reports a net loss of long-distance movements. These losses were, however, temporary, moving to neutral and positive balances in 2021 and 2022. This contrasts with a systematic pattern of net migration losses observed for the Metropolitan Region of Santiago over the last 20 years.",

    "description": "Does the media enhance issue accountability? Many argue it does by covering where politicians stand on policy. However, evidence of this process is limited and fails to address two alternatives. First, when informed about an issue by the media, people may change their own issue stance so it aligns with a politician they already support. Second, the public may ignore the news when it conflicts with party loyalty. We distinguish these alternatives using survey experiments and observational studies of local media and the public's use of issues to evaluate their members of Congress from 2006 to 2022. Across these settings local news increases the public's reliance on policy to evaluate politicians, affirming the media's contribution to issue accountability despite heightened polarization. These studies also highlight a mechanism behind this, showing news primarily changes views of legislators by reducing widespread uncertainty about their policy positions.",

Changes of research directions are thereby assumed to influence the evolution of science in general. Research has shown that such changes may also affect the success of individual scientists in their careers. However, the gender dimension of this aspect of career development is so far understudied. There is also need for more dynamic indicators to record and interpret career developments in macro data. This study combines the gender perspective with the introduction of new indicators. We selected more than 29,000 scientists in Physics & Astronomy and studied them over six decades using a bibliographic dataset from Scopus. We find that women are less likely to change research directions than their men counterparts, and that the research performance of women is less negatively affected by changing research directions.

Methodologically, we turn a large-scale bibliometric dataset (Scopus raw data) into a comprehensive, longitudinal data source for research on careers in science. The global science system is highly immobile: half of global top performers continue their careers as top performers and one-third of global bottom performers as bottom performers. Jumpers-Up and Droppers-Down are extremely rare in science. The chances of moving radically up or down in productivity classes are marginal (1% or less).

Drawing on educational census data (INVALSI) on mathematics and reading skills of more than half-a-million students in fifth and sixth grade, we develop a refined adjacent-grade discontinuity design (AGD) that, in contrast to previous applications, can separate the effects of school-year exposure from the effects of both chronological age and relative age in classroom. Results demonstrate that school exposure has clearly contributed to narrowing disparities in learning by social and migration background. However, schooling did not equalize gender gaps in neither reading or math. In fact, results suggest boys gaining comparably more from schooling.

    "description": "In recent years mental health has become a prominent topic in society. Mental health has often been ignored or integrated very minimally within society. However, one place in society constantly finds itself within the spotlight and forefront of mental health, educational institutions. These places have always been a prevalent part of this field due to their ability to help society at large through primary and secondary prevention. Primary prevention involves providing interventions to stop mental health issues from arising in the first place. This form of prevention teaches students healthy habits for their mental health and helps prevent illnesses. Secondary prevention involves preventing the further growth of mental health issues through prevention after the issue has already been diagnosed. Both prevention methods are utilized across the broad spectrum of students schools carry. Due to this broad spectrum, schools have been the grounds for many famous studies conducted by many famous scientists. In recent years, more and more money has been put into furthering mental health resources at schools. Legislation such as the Mental Health Services Grant Program provided 144 million to schools for mental health resources. However, the question becomes, how are these mental health resources being utilized? This correlational study aims to address the current gap in research for a need for data that is not diluted due to many confounding variables and provides information on trends of utilization of resources provided by school districts. To accomplish this we utilized vast surveys with each high school's Ohio State University clinician and Social Worker. This study collected responses from each staff member each time they met with a student on topics discussed and general demographics. This data was finally analyzed and tested to find general trends within the central Ohio school district. Some of the major findings and trends included that sophomores are most likely to go to the staff for help, the number of students that made a certain number of staff visits decreases exponentially for each increasing visit, women are more likely to go for help, and Caucasians are most likely to go for mental health. Further analysis by the school\u2019s OSU Clicican and Social worker revealed more data such as Asians almost always are the least represented in mental health cases despite their proportion of the student body. Further anxiety and stress are the most commonly discussed topics between staff and students. This data provides a basic understanding of the relationship between mental health and high school students. This could be the gateway to the effective application of solutions presented in primary and secondary prevention studies. Furthermore, a better understanding of how mental health issues affect the student body can result in more efficient utilization of funding and resources by school districts and allow for more targeted interventions.

    "link": "https://share.osf.io/preprint/E0084-B66-F08",
    "description": "Expulsion or exclusion from school is a common event in the lives of people who have experience of the criminal justice system. Exclusion underpins the \u2018school-to-prison pipeline\u2019 and is, accordingly, one of the most contentious policies used in education systems. Critics of exclusion powers claim that it is a direct cause of later offending behaviour, among other adverse outcomes, while supporters of this power argue that it is necessary for maintaining school discipline and safety. Evidence for or against a causal effect of exclusion on offending is inhibited by random allocation of exclusion not being available on ethical grounds and the generally low internal validity of studies in this area. To advance understanding of the causal connection between school exclusion and offending \u2013 specifically, serious violent offending \u2013 this study leverages a recent national linkage of educational and criminal justice records in England to emulate a randomised controlled trial using a target trial framework. Across more than 20,000 matched pairs of excluded and not excluded children, within twelve months of target trial entry, the hazard ratio for serious violence was 2.04 (95% CI: 1.83, 2.28) and for homicide/near-miss homicide was 2.36 (95% CI: 1.07, 5.20). We discuss the implications of these findings for theory and policy in education and criminal justice as well as discussing the extent to which the observed relationships can be considered causal.",

    "link": "https://share.osf.io/preprint/E019F-823-4FD",
    "description": "Research on instability has focused on how discrete, unitary forms of instability, like residential or household change, hurt families. Similarly, unauthorized legal status is associated with negative outcomes for immigrant families. There has been less exploration of how the experience of instability changes when those experiencing it, must also contend with undocumented status. Thematic analysis of 50 semi-structured interviews with undocumented and DACA-recipient immigrants suggests that respondents and their families experience \u201cnested instability\u201d, the interaction and compounding of nation-state, residential, and household transitions. This nested form of instability simultaneously destabilize immigrant lives at both the national and household societal levels. In addition, lacking a regular legal status hurt respondents\u2019 ability to cope with nested instability by restricting access to economic resources, institutions and services, and deportation protection. Future research on instability and mixed-status families should consider the form of instability that these families face and how it complicates the process of adapting to a changing national context. Immigration policy and services should also consider the many components of nested instability to better serve migrant families.",

    "description": "French Pragmatism or the Pragmatic Sociology of Critique (PSC), offers a valuable framework to analyse the argumentations of ordinary actors within situations of public dispute. However, due to the PSC\u2019s inherent (rationalistic) focus on providing a \u2018practical grammar of the political bond\u2019 (see Blokker & Brighenti 2011) the more disruptive processes of such disputes as well as the role of emotion(s), have remained under-explained in the overall PSC literature and hence the question as to \u2018why regimes shift\u2019. In an attempt to address these particular deficits, this paper extends the existing PSC framework by means of suggestive actions and emotive speech, offering them as additional analytical categories alongside the existing orders of worth. After operationalizing this extension into a semi-standardized neopragmatist discourse analysis, two case-studies that applied this new approach will be presented in its support. With this paper I am attempting to provide a semi-standardized PSC-based method that allows for the investigation of all \u2018real-world\u2019 (occidental) situations of public dispute, including those that cause \u2018political breaks\u2019.",

Black Americans experience higher age-specific mortality rates than White Americans throughout most of the life course, but this puzzlingly reverses at advanced ages. The leading explanation for the Black-White mortality crossover centers around selective mortality over the life course. Black Americans who survived higher age-specific mortality risk throughout their life course are highly selected on robustness, and have lower mortality than White Americans in late life. However, skeptics argue the Black-White mortality crossover is simply a data artifact from age misreporting or related data quality issues. We use large-scale linked administrative data (N = 2.3 million) to document the BlackWhite mortality crossover for cohorts born in the early 20 th century. We find evidence the crossover is not a data artifact and cannot be uncrossed using sociodemographic characteristics alone.",

Technologically infused infrastructures of buildings, transport and communication together with time based obligations of work and recreation intertwines with the physical spaces of built environment and human coexistence to create complex layers of \u2018being\u2019 in place. We have begun to explore being and belonging in place through the exploration of self through literature in the context of a student-tutor research partnership entitled Reading and Writing the City, based in a final year undergraduate study module.

    "description": "Scholars substantially contribute to innovation in knowledge economies. Identifying where scholars come from and move to is a core focus of the recent literature. However, whether collaboration networks of scholars affect where they move next is understudied. Studies which do consider scholarly migration and collaboration in tandem report paradoxical findings. We take a two pronged approach, considering both how spatial representations of mobility and collaboration networks compare and how collaboration patterns of mobile authors relate to their movement between institutions. We selected a random sample of authors worldwide from Scopus 2020 data based on number of publications, corresponding authorship, publication in top-ranked journals, and mobility status to construct comparable control/observation groups. Our results enabled us to resolve the paradoxical effect between collaboration and mobility. We found that while the histories of these two variables are highly similar across groups, embedding representations of collaboration are more densely packed than those for mobility which could indicate higher costs of mobility than collaboration. Authors who are mobile or identified as top performers, top 1\\% based on our selection criteria, are more likely to have a higher number of collaborators. Furthermore, though few authors collaborate only before or after a mobility event, collaboration increases leading up to a mobility event and the majority of publications with a target institution are published prior to the initial move there. Hence our rigorous investigation using multiple methodologies show that the aggregate direction of effect is from collaboration to mobility. Our methodological framework opens up promising avenues for future research on individual level forecasting of scholarly migration and on global dynamics of academic talent circulation.",

Building on existing research and other reflections, including literature reviews, seven important and relevant arguments are raised. Among these are the ontological and epistemological foundations; by argument, designs should be separated from artifacts, and from designing and designers. In addition, the arguments include observations and critical points about terminology, longitudinal research and the evolution of designs and artifacts, evaluation of artifacts and designs, ethics, and education. With these critical arguments, the paper contributes to the disciplinary discussion in the design science field and information systems in general by elaborating problems that need attention.

    "description": "Double robust methods for flexible covariate adjustment in causal inference have proliferated in recent years. Despite their apparent advantages, these methods are rarely used by social scientists. It is also unclear whether these methods actually outperform more traditional methods in finite samples. This paper has two aims: It is a guide to some of the latest methods in double robust, flexible covariate adjustment using machine learning, and it compares these methods to more traditional statistical methods and flexible \"single robust\" methods. It does this by using both simulated data where the treatment effect estimate is known, and then by replicating some prominent articles in sociology that use simpler methods. Double robust methods covered include Augmented Inverse Probability Weighting (AIPW), Targeted Maximum Likelihood Estimation (TMLE), and Double/Debiased Machine Learning (DML). Results suggest that some of these methods do outperform traditional methods in a wide range of simulations, but only slightly. In particular, the top performers are TMLE and AIPW in conjunction with flexible machine learning estimators. But G-computation with the same flexible estimators obtains almost identical results, and simple regression methods have only slightly higher bias and are much more computationally efficient. In the article replications, the application of double robust methods substantively changes some, but not all, of the results, highlighting the importance of comparing performance from multiple estimators.",

    "description": "We argue that discriminatory practices may vary significantly across decision-makers, which allows for deeper insights into the mechanisms behind discrimination. We study this in the context of biased grading in schools. We develop a theory of teacher biases driven by heuristic beliefs stemming from concrete classroom experiences. Because teachers may also care about grade equality, such a mechanism can lead to either inequality-reinforcing or compensating biases in grading. Based on large-scale administrative data on Danish lower secondary students, we find strong evidence for highly heterogeneous teacher biases - up to 45% of teachers exhibit a bias that is of the opposite sign as the average bias. Furthermore, there is a robust and substantively large compensation effect. Teachers who experienced a visible demographic group (defined by gender or migration background) academically under-performing relative to a reference group show more positive bias towards that group than teachers where the same group over-performed. We find little evidence for alternative explanations of bias. To fully grasp discrimination, we must go beyond averages and consider the wide variety of biases shaped by individual experiences.",

    "description": "Open Science programs are structured educational, research and technical projects that support the application of Open Science practices in universities. While previous research on Open Science has focused on topics such as Open Access, data sharing and data reuse, a very limited number of studies examine the implementation of Open Science in knowledge institutions, such as universities. Consequently, we don\u2019t have a comprehensive understanding of how Open Science works in knowledge institutions such as universities. This article aims to bridge this gap by focusing on the monitoring and evaluation of Open Science programs. We present the outcome of an empirical study proposing a monitoring framework for Open Science programs. This framework, developed through semi-structured interviews and participant observations, was rigorously validated during two focus groups involving Open Science experts. The proposed monitoring framework comprises seven key themes: Open Science as an ecosystem, Epistemic Cultures, Governance, Technical Infrastructure, Funding, Open Science as a process, and Reflexivity. We describe the study\u2019s results using the responsive evaluation method, which is most suitable in complex social systems and is recognized as a learning process by the evaluation\u2019s stakeholders. This paper makes two key contributions to the interdisciplinary discussion on Open Science. Firstly, by examining the lack of research on the operationalization of Open Science programs in universities, this study highlights the necessity of adopting a comprehensive and organizational perspective. Secondly, by presenting a framework to help universities monitor their Open Science programs, this study tangibly contributes to the management of Open Science in universities and knowledge institutions.",

    "description": "Research has identified socioeconomic disparity in university enrollment due to a higher likelihood to stop applying after an initial rejection among individuals from less educated families. We investigate the role of education-linked genes alongside family background and experiencing mental illness and other major life events in predicting (re-)application to university. We further examine the later socioeconomic outcomes of individuals who are more persistent in their educational goals. Utilizing longitudinal genetically informed register data from Finland, we analyze a sample of 6,101 individuals born 1987-1990 followed up until 2018. The study uses parental polygenic scores to assess the genetic endowment to high educational attainment (EDU-PGS) combined with information on application behavior (1,683 individuals experienced rejection) and socioeconomic variables. Multinomial and binary logistic regression models and discrete time hazard models are employed. Our findings indicate an intricate interplay of genetic endowments, income and education of the parents, (re-)application behavior, and early adulthood income and occupational status. Individuals with a higher EDU-PGS were more likely to reapply after rejection, suggesting a genetic component in persistence in educational goals and application behaviors beyond family background. Mental illness did not have an effect over and above other included indicators on stop applying, and there was no evidence for the presence of gene-environment interactions. Moreover, application behavior mediated the influence of the polygenic score on occupational status in early adulthood. The study contributes to the broader equality of opportunity debate and shows how genes express themselves in our smaller or bigger decisions. The joint contribution of genetic and family factors has a crucial role in shaping educational trajectories and later socioeconomic outcomes.",

Recently, there has been an increasing interest in using language models to examine social aspects through social science lenses. However, critical computing scholars have shown that models embody specific societal values and perspectives. This inherent encoding of viewpoints means that when these models are employed in research, scholars might not reflect the worldview or use theoretical perspectives. To address this issue, our study explores the possibility of fine-tuning large language models with a specific Weltanschauung. Specifically, we incorporate the writings of Marx and Engels to fine-tune these models, aiming to infuse them with Marxist ideological terminology and worldview. We evaluate how these fine-tuned models differ in empirical analysis.

    "description": "Child abuse and neglect are consistently found at higher rates in families facing low income and income insecurity, and in contexts with lower public spending on children and families. However, child abuse and neglect, particularly as measured through engagement with child protective services, has deep intergenerational and institutional causes, casting doubt on the effectiveness of income transfers alone to reduce it. In 2018, Aotearoa New Zealand introduced a \u201cFamilies Package\u201d of policies, including a small, unconditional cash transfer to mothers with children under three years of age, which increased family income by 5\\% on average. Using four years of national administrative child protective services and hospitalization data and difference-in-difference models, we find that the introduction of the Families Package was associated with a 19\\% (OR: 0.81, CI: 0.80-0.81, p.value=0.003) reduction in overall referrals to family services in nonurgent cases of suspected maltreatment, without significant changes in urgent cases.

The Families Package likely also reduced neglect in single-mother families (OR 0.6, CI: 0.38 - 0.93, p.value=0.022). We find no statistically significant effects, however, on social worker findings of emotional or physical abuse, or for hospitalizations for traumatic brain injury.",

At the same time, other norms become more important both among scientists and journalists: transparency and contextualization of information.

    "link": "https://share.osf.io/preprint/E00A7-89E-50F",
    "description": "Large Language Models (LLMs) promise to transform the social sciences through cost-effective predictions of human behavior. However, despite growing evidence that LLMs can misrepresent such behavior, current approaches to studying causal effects with LLMs require researchers to assume that predicted and observed behavior are interchangeable. Instead, we argue that human subjects should serve as a gold standard to correct misrepresentations within a mixed subjects design. This paradigm offers valid and more precise estimates of causal effects at a lower cost than experiments relying solely on human subjects. We demonstrate\u2013and extend\u2013prediction-powered inference, a statistical method that instantiates the mixed subjects design. Our innovation is a power analysis for optimally choosing between informative but costly human subjects and less informative but cheap predictions of human behavior. Mixed subjects designs could enhance scientific productivity and reduce inequality in access to costly evidence on research questions by offering valid, precise, and cost-effective inferences on causal effects and other parameters.",

    "description": "Do individuals in the upper class have siblings with similar class positions to themselves? Using data based on the entire registered population in Norway, this article describes brothers\u2019 and sisters\u2019 class destinations with particular attention to the upper class and top wealth positions. The study first describes upper-class recruitment across families of different classes, finding similarities in siblings\u2019 social mobility. Concerning upper-class reproduction, first- and secondborn siblings from families with top wealth are particularly likely to both reach upper-class positions. Second, the paper describes how upper-class members tend to have siblings with similar class positions to themselves in terms of both vertical class and horizontal positions according to individuals\u2019 composition of cultural and economic capital. By adopting a class-theoretical framework for sibling outcomes, the work sheds light on the social connectedness between social class positions that emerge through intergenerational mobility. The wealthiest 0.2% are shown to have siblings who are disproportionally often not only situated in higher class positions, but also in the economic fraction of the upper and middle classes.",

    "description": "In this paper, we explore how members of the scientific community leave academic science and how attrition (defined as ceasing to publish) differs across genders, academic disciplines, and over time. Our approach is cohort-based and longitudinal: We track individual male and female scientists over time and quantify the phenomenon traditionally referred to as \u201cleaving science.\u201d Using publication metadata from Scopus\u2014a global bibliometric database of publications and citations\u2014we follow the details of the publishing careers of scientists from 38 OECD countries who started publishing in 2000 (N = 142,776) and 2010 (N = 232,843). Our study is restricted to 16 STEMM disciplines (science, technology, engineering, mathematics, and medicine), and we track the individual scholarly output of the two cohorts until 2022. We use survival analysis to compare attrition of men and women scientists. With more women in science and more women within cohorts, attrition is becoming ever less gendered. In addition to the combined aggregated changes at the level of all STEMM disciplines, widely nuanced changes were found to occur at the discipline level and over time. Attrition in science means different things for men versus women depending on the discipline; moreover, it means different things for scientists from different cohorts entering the scientific workforce. Finally, global bibliometric datasets were tested in the current study, opening new opportunities to explore gender and disciplinary differences in attrition.",

    "link": "https://share.osf.io/preprint/E0147-50E-7B6",
    "description": "In this research, the contributions of a highly productive minority of scientists to the national Polish research output over the past three decades (1992\u20132021) is explored. In almost all previous research, the approaches to high research productivity are missing the time component. Cross-sectional studies were not complemented by longitudinal studies: Scientists comprising the classes of top performers have not been tracked over time. Three classes of top performers (the upper 1%, 5%, and 10%) are examined, and a surprising temporal stability of productivity patterns is found. The 1/10 and 10/50 rules consistently apply across the three decades: The upper 1% of scientists, on average, account for 10% of the national output, and the upper 10% account for almost 50% of total output, with significant disciplinary variations. The Relative Presence Index (RPI) we constructed shows that men are overrepresented and women underrepresented in all top performers classes. Top performers are studied longitudinally through their detailed publishing histories, with micro-data coming from the raw Scopus dataset. Econometric models identify the three most important predictors that change the odds ratio estimates of membership in the top performance classes: gender, academic age, and research collaboration. The downward trend in fixed effects over successive six-year periods indicates increasing competition in academia. A large population of all internationally visible Polish scientists (N=152,043) with their 587,558 articles is studied. Implications for high-productivity studies are shown, and limitations are discussed.",

Using linked employer\u2013employee data from nine European and North American countries, we document that the segregation of immigrant-background workers in lower-paying jobs accounts for about four-fifths of immigrant\u2013native earnings differences. However, within-job pay inequality remains consequential in several countries.

    "description": "With targeted childcare initiatives and welfare-to-work programmes policy-makers have sought to address employment activation of lonemothers and negative outcomes for children in lone parent households. The present study examines non-parental childcare use and maternal employment among children living in lone and co-parent family situations at ages three and four and emotional and behavioural difficulties at ages four and five. The results demonstrate that negative outcomes associated with lone motherhood are explained largely bymother\u2019s age, education, material circumstances and area deprivation; and that maternal employment does not relieve lone mothers\u2019 disadvantages in a way that alleviates the risks of difficulties to their children.However, in any family constellation,mainly group-based formal pre-school childcare does have a positive impact on child difficulties compared to drawing on informal childcare arrangements as main provider. In addition, and specifically for the difficulties of children in lone mother family situations, any non-parental childcare \u2013 formal or informal \u2212 for at least twenty-five hours per week is beneficial. Study findings support policy agendas which tackle families\u2019 material hardship beyond promoting mothers\u2019 employment, and through investment in formal childcare provision, and also through arrangements allowing lone mothers to divide their weekly load of childcare with another main provider.",

We included a sample of 128 mathematics teacher educators in the survey through non-probability sampling.

Drawing on the social psychology and social science literature, it examines whether childhood behavioral traits measured by the Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire (SDQ) influence concerns about discrimination. Using the Growing Up in Ireland longitudinal dataset, the study shows that internalizing behaviors in childhood (such as loneliness and frequent worry) correlate positively with later concerns about discrimination, while externalizing behaviors (such as strong temperament and impulsivity) show a negative correlation. When analyzing whether the results are socially stratified, we show that they are more pronounced for native males. The results suggest that childhood experiences shape political attitudes before political preferences crystallize and underscore the importance of understanding the developmental origins of discrimination concerns.",

    "link": "https://share.osf.io/preprint/E01A7-B81-8C0",
    "description": "Farmers are often advised to hedge their commodity prices on the commodity futures exchange, without sound scientific evidence to support this. This paper questions this rash advice and analyzes the impact of various hedging strategies based on wheat futures for a large sample of farms in Germany. Historical simulation is used to evaluate the hedging efficiency for 2,197 German farms over a 21-year study period. Adopting a whole-farm economic risk approach, we use \u201cadjusted farm profit\u201d as performance indicator and measure for each of these farms which relative change in profit volatility would have been obtained by nine different hedging strategies. A cluster analysis was used to identify whether there are farm types that show particularly low or high hedging efficiencies. Contrary to expectations, hedging would not have reduced but slightly increased profit volatility in most cases and across different regions, farm types, and farm sizes. In addition, hedging would have led to a reduction in profit levels in most cases due to hedging costs and/or speculative losses. In other words, the majority of the farms would not have been able to \u201cbeat the market\u201d and hedging would have led to per-verse effects, as it would have caused costs, but instead of the desired reduction of whole-farm risk, it would have increased risk. This paper presents an in-depth analysis of the effects of hedging based on wheat futures contracts. Unlike previous hedging studies that used synthetic farm models or rather small samples, we use a whole-farm economic risk approach and conduct a large-scale study of 2,197 individual farms over a 21-year study period. The study results cast substantial doubt on the conventional wisdom that farmers should be more willing to include hedging as \u201cinnovative\u201d tool into their risk management.",

Using population-based experiments leveraging real-world interviews with extreme right activists on Sky News UK and Australia, we test if media exposure leads to higher agreement with extreme right statements. We also test if exposure affects perceptions of how many others agree with these statements. Our findings are consistent across both countries: exposure to uncritical interviews increases agreement with extreme statements and perceptions of broader support in the population. Testing the media strategy in the UK, we find that critical interviewing tarnishes the activist\u2019s image and reduces effects but still heightens perceived support for extreme statements. This study identifies a mechanism through which extreme political ideas spread and offers insights into media strategies to counteract persuasion and normalisation effects.",

    "description": "Large-scale cooperation among unrelated humans remains an evolutionary puzzle. Cultural group selection theory suggests that strong intergroup selection drives the evolution of cooperation, given substantial behavioral variation between groups. This study investigated payoff-biased imitation of successful out-groups as an intergroup selection process, specifically as an alternative to warfare-based mechanisms. We thus conducted two experiments manipulating exposure to cooperative out-group information in public goods games, demonstrating that cooperative behavior can indeed transmit across group boundaries, thereby influencing decision-making processes. However, this effect gradually diminished within groups, and transmitted cooperation was not likely to spread. Additionally, we performed a cross-cultural survey examining relationships between press freedom, which is a proxy for accessibility to out-group information, and different types of prosociality. The results revealed contrasting relationships, particularly in democratic countries: higher press freedom positively predicted impersonal prosociality (e.g., generalized trust) while negatively predicting personal prosociality (e.g., trust in family). These findings suggest that cultural processes such as payoff-biased imitation can facilitate the spread of cooperation beyond group boundaries, serving as a potential channel for intergroup selection. Finally, we discuss the implications for cultural group selection theory and additional mechanisms\u2019 potential role in sustaining within-group cooperation.",

This coexistence is contingent on the nature and frequency of human-animal interactions (HAI) that are primarily shaped by public attitudes and values. 2. We designed a questionnaire using the Wildlife Attitudes and Values (WAVS) and Wildlife Value Orientation (WVO) frameworks to investigate public attitudes and values to a feral megaherbivore, the water buffalo (Bubalus bubalis), living in and around the South Lantau region of Hong Kong. We collected 657 questionnaire responses (online = 550, in-person =107) and additional comments from 56 respondents who completed their questionnaire in person. 3. We conducted a principal component analysis using the questionnaire responses related to WAVS and WVO. Three key dimensions were found: Buffalo Appreciation, Social Benefits, and Tolerance, which accounted for 67.63% of the variance in the data. We conducted a thematic analysis of the additional comments to further explore how these dimensions contextualise public attitudes and values to buffalo. 4. Based on 472 responses where all demographic data (self-reported gender, age, district of residence, residency of South Lantau, ethnicity, education level, and place of birth) were available, we conducted logistic regression analyses to investigate the effects of these demographic characteristics on Buffalo Appreciation, Social Benefits, and Tolerance. We found significant associations between gender, district of residence, education level, and place of birth with Buffalo Appreciation, Social Benefits, and Tolerance, implying a complex interplay between public attitudes and values toward a feral animal and their relationships with the natural environment and ecosystem. Fifty-six respondents provided a total of 237 additional comments, highlighting Safety concerns and issues, Emotion and sentiment, and Livelihood impacts as key themes. 5. Studying public attitudes and values, such as appreciation for feral buffalo in Hong Kong, potentially points to methods for successful strategies using buffalo as \u2018agents\u2019 of conservation.

This process is located in a broader context of practices that shape the ritual in a multi-sensory environment that imprints a process of memory and remembrance in the brain. Moreover, the flexibility of this ritual to take globalized influences, foods and discourses (as in the names of recipes) allows it to perpetuate itself and thus continue to play a central role in the calendar of festivities in Mexico. Food is in this sense a gustatory-visual-olfactory social artifact that is valued and requires an extra investment and effort to be made. An extra effort that is necessary as it links the need for nourishment of the dead that is fulfilled by the alive while they remember. This process of remembrance allows for the dead to be part of the social realm of the alive. Food acts, in this sense as a mediator. By exciting multiple senses it imprints the brain with memories and the calendar with a festivity to look for, one that has transcended globalization, clashes of cultures, uneven structures of power and tourism.

(2) How is the food prepared and what are the differences between the amateur chefs (contestants) and the professional chefs (judges) and how those differences are highlighted by gender differences in which the male chef is contrasted with the female chef.

I argue that the image that is represented in MCC is a highly centralized version of the nation that depicts a modern nation in the supermarket as the modern place to obtain food, a dominant male urban chef, and urban areas that entitle themselves with a sense of omnivorousness when it comes to international and national food knowledge. The image of National cuisine that arises is a fragmented and skewed one that doesn\u2019t take into account the rural, the female chefs and the regions.",

    "description": "In June 16 2014 Starbucks opened its first store in Bogot\u00e1, Colombia. This paper analyzes how the Colombian identity as a nation of coffee shaped the reaction by the major Colombian newspaper before and after the arrival of Starbucks. In order to frame my research I relied on secondary sources to understand the history of the Colombian coffee culture and the three main areas that contributed to shape Colombia\u2019s identity as a coffee nation: (1) a small scale production from which thousands of families depended, (2) an avid global market for coffee and (3) the successful establishment of FNC in 1927 which confronted the 1980\u2019s coffee crisis by changing its strategy as a raw coffee producer into a consumer oriented brand as a measure after the 1989 coffee crisis. On the other hand, the relation between coffee and identity in Bogot\u00e1. Its major urban center, revolves around notions of semi-public spaces usually dominated by man. With this framework in mind I analyzed my primary sources on Eltiempo.com during 2014 by looking at the anticipation to the arrival of Starbucks and to what happened during the arrival and after it. I focused on two aspects (1) how the Starbucks arrival contrasts with the acquisition of OMA, by a Costa Rican investment fund, which raised no comments and (2) the strategy that Starbucks adopted in order to enter the Colombian market by focusing on a discourse of respect and help to the Colombian growers. I argue that particular historical responses were important in shaping the Identity of Colombia as a nation of coffee producers but that this has not been translated into the realm of consumption, in spite of the recent efforts by the FNC, thus on the consumption side the arrival of Starbucks will increase consumption and perhaps foster a consumer oriented culture of coffee.",

    "description": "The emergence of nation-states in Central and Eastern Europe at the beginning of the 20th century created the need to manage ethnic diversity and issues with drawing boundaries between ethnic communities. This resulted in the minority activism, aimed not only at protecting the interests of minorities, but also at ensuring their survival. This article focusses on the latter aspect. The article shows that research on country-level minority activism helps better understand majority-minority relations and their impact on the society by analysing the example of interwar Estonia. The German minority elite\u2019s perceptions of ethnicity will be discussed, based on the documentation reflecting the inclusion policy of the German Cultural SelfGovernment, the autonomous institutional body of the German minority in Estonia. The article demonstrates the remarkably constructivist views of the German minority elite and explains their genesis and background. It will be argued that first, German elite\u2019s constructivist perceptions had historical roots; second, the elite needed to be pragmatically open rather than primordially protectionist for their dwindling community to survive; and third, they had no reason for protectionism stemming from the fear of malicious infiltration of members of other ethnic groups. Since such an open inclusion policy turned out to be relatively successful, it can be concluded that the German minority, which formed the ruling elite in Estonia earlier centuries, continued to be attractive, and this, in turn, caused significant social tensions, making the Estonians, now being in a dominant position and in the numerical majority, doubt their own survival. The results of this article ultimately highlight the relevance of instrumentalisation of ethnic ambiguities in forming minority activism and drawing boundaries between majority and minorities.",

    "link": "https://share.osf.io/preprint/E001C-333-16C",
    "description": "An unexpected, symbolic, vivid, and personally captivating experience led me to write this book. This involved my capturing many open-ended hierarchies of information associated with that intuitive experience. I was at first drawn to notions of \u201cconditional\u201d and \u201cunconditional\u201d human love. As I dug deeper into describing my experience, these notions transformed into the more specific terms of \u201cconditional-only human interests\u201d and \u201cboth-and human love.\u201d Building upon published data and intuitive logic, I recognized that \u201cconditional human interests\u201d can and do often unfold without the presence of any altruism by social subjects toward their social objects. In contrast, the presence of human altruism cannot and does not occur without the simultaneous presence of \u201cconditional human interests.\u201d A ubiquitously-asymmetrical, holarchically-systematized, human-interaction dynamic has, since antiquity, dynamically characterized and circulated around this asymmetrical yet holarchical and hierarchical exchange among people. This is herein postulated and asserted to be operating cross-culturally. Data, utilizing an Integral, cross-disciplinary, socio-evolutionary perspective, helps organize this report. I assert that conditional human interests are universally recognized and/or offered among all people, in each and every social interaction or circumstance. In contrast, what is socio-evolutionary defined \u201clove\u201d will not always be recognized and/or offered within every interaction or circumstance. Accurate identification of \u201clove\u201d from a socio-evolutionary perspective requires a \u201cboth-and\u201d quality between parties, meaning that personal interests AND altruism must both concomitantly occur to qualify as a \u201clove\u201d interaction. Love, described as \u201cboth-and\u201d in nature, using Love Value Orientation (LVO) theory terminology, creates a uniquely different kind of inter-holonic interaction field in comparison to \u201cconditional-only\u201d human interest interaction fields. \u201cBoth-and\u201d interaction fields afford parties an ultimately greater variety of satisfying and sustaining options. These will tend to be more aesthetically beautiful, inspiring, and ultimately more inclusively empowering options. These \u201cboth-and\u201d options can also be more fine tuned than simply conditional options. Personal interests with altruism, when both evident within a given individual or population, will arguably occur in various kinds of balance. Strategic expressions of conditional interests and unconditional altruism, in various forms of balance, are argued to be cardinal ingredients of a simultaneously destructive, constructive, and creatively evolving human process of individual and collective development. Within this context, I ask: \u27a2 To what extent are conditions for human dignity being included, locally, regionally, and world-wide in what we humans are individually and collectively creating? Humans are unique. Among all biotically embedded holons known to humankind, people possess, by far, the most complex capacities for interior and external perspective-taking and information-processing. Given the ubiquitous presence of people in relation to each and every human affair, the uniquely cardinal role of human consciousness \u2014 individual and collective \u2014 can be noted in regard to virtually all human interests. The heuristic nature of intuitive human-to-human love consciousness is explored as a common, relatively stable predisposition across social circumstances, yet what can be a fluid and situation-specific dimension of interaction associated with altruism. To what extent might this intuitive \u201cboth-and\u201d human-to-human love consciousness represent an increasingly conscious -- and increasingly cross-cultural -- aspect of the human pursuit and organization of successful human affairs locally and globally, short-term and long-term? Integral clarifications will be particularly advantageous here.",

    "link": "https://share.osf.io/preprint/E01EC-6E5-37B",
    "description": "While Sociology has historically engaged with the transformative social experiences associated with technology since the Industrial Revolution, the study of civilian \u201cdrones\u201d (or unmanned aerial vehicles) in their current societal ubiquity has surprisingly remained neglected. This dissertation addresses this gap by taking the under-examined practice of civilian drone operations as its object of analysis and conducting an in-depth inquiry into civilian drone culture. Through an abductive, multi-sited investigation of drone pilots\u2019 experiences, this study provides a sociologically-informed understanding of the processes that structure the identities and social practices of civilian drone pilots, as well as their role in the shaping of technonatural knowledge within the rapidly expanding \u201cDrone Society\u201d. By doing so, this dissertation positions civilian drones and their pilots as central components within an emergent social order, extending them far beyond their militaristic contexts, regulatory concerns, and other technical domains. Through its research questions and an interdisciplinary approach, the dissertation examines the mechanisms that concern the process of \u201cbecoming\u201d a drone pilot, the nature of work within the drone society, the relationship between precarity and the use of civilian drones, and finally, the influence of drone media (i.e., drone photographs, videos, and other data) on perceptions of both, built and natural environments. Analysis of data collected through 29 in-depth qualitative interviews, participant observation, and digital ethnography performed over a year reveals how civilian drone pilots construct and negotiate their identities within broader technocultural networks and how civilian drone culture is often marked by a spirit of collaboration, economic informality and the exchange of specialized forms of knowledge. This dissertation\u2019s findings also furnish an examination of the gendered dimensions of drone operation, highlighting significant exclusionary practices that result from the masculinization of technical expertise and novel forms of precarity that civilian drone pilots are exposed to daily. Crucially, the analysis reveals how the use of drones and drone media creates dual perceptions of environments (on a physical and digital level), and how an interplay between physical and digital realities fosters new forms of spatial knowledge, awareness, and experience, thus reshaping how people perceive and engage with their surroundings. Collectively, these findings underscore how drones are redefining social organization, leisure, work, and epistemic practices, thus positioning them as influential actors in the contemporary sociotechnical landscape.",

Our sample consists of 5,518 higher ed protests involving 585 universities and colleges between 2012 and 2018. We find higher ed protests most commonly concern university governance, anti-racism, and labor. Protest frequency is patterned by the academic calendar. Large protest waves reveal specific issues animating mass mobilizations: racist police violence, racially hostile campus climates, and Trump\u2019s election in the United States, and public tuition, austerity, and labor conditions in Canada. University administrations and police usually avoided extensive intervention during protests.

    "description": "Background: In social sciences, ensuring a high level of instrument validation is crucial for upholding the principles of scientific rigor and maintaining the overall quality of research. Objectives: To develop and evaluate an AI chatbot and website for instrument validation, assess their impact on instrument validity improvement, and analyze user perceptions. Methods: Adopting a quantitative design, the study was anchored on the developed Research Instrument Validation Framework (RIVF) of Villarino (2024). Moreover, it was evaluated through users' perceptions (n=100) by administering an online survey, whereby the employment of paired t-tests used contrasting instrument validity-pre-vs post-RIVF scores, and one-way ANOVA was used to determine if a relationship existed between users' perceptions and overall improvement in instrument validity. A G*Power analysis indicated that there was sufficient statistical power for the analyses: for paired t-tests, it was 99.73% (n = 100, dz = 0.5, \u03b1 = 0.05), and for one-way ANOVA, 80.95% (n = 100, f = 0.25, \u03b1=0.05, four groups). All data were analyzed using IBM SPSS version 26. Results: Post-RIVF use, all the validity domains showed significant improvements (p<0.001), but the primary considerable improvement was in construct validity [Mean difference=1.20\u00b10.60, t(49)=14.14]. Participants perceived the AI chatbot as more useful [4.30\u00b10.70 vs. 3.80\u00b10.80, p<0.001] compared to the RIFV website. Conclusion: This AI-powered milieu indicates a potential for increasing the validity of research instruments in RIVF, while an AI chatbot efficiently increments the construct validity. These findings would infer that using AI technologies potentially enhances the quality of research instruments in the social sciences alongside traditional validation methods.

    "description": "Objectives This article explores the scale and seasonal patterns of mobility at the complex settlement site of Q\u0131zqala during the Middle Bronze Age (2400\u20131,500 BCE). By integrating human bone, teeth, and environmental samples this research tests the hypothesis of the persistent importance of community-wide seasonal pastoral transhumance during the early formation of complex settlement systems of the South Caucasus. Methods This research applies stable oxygen and radiogenic strontium isotope analyses on incremental samples of human tooth enamel, bulk tooth enamel, and bone to resolve mobility patterns. Sequential and bulk sampling techniques elucidate seasonal and residential mobility behaviors. Extensive environmental isotope samples of plant and water were collected through regional survey and establish local and regional isotopic baselines, which are compared to human isotope analysis results. Results Q\u0131zqala individuals exhibit low isotopic variability compared to regional contemporaries. 87Sr/86Sr ratios from human remains indicate seasonal and residential isotopic variability within the baseline ranges of local landscapes. \u03b418O values display erratic patterns, but correspond to seasonal variability with fluctuations between highland and lowland altitudinal zone baseline values. Conclusions Results suggest that isotopic analysis of multiple elements and sequential enamel samples offers finer resolution on the complexities of human mobility strategies and elucidate the daily lives of often overlooked mobile populations. Higher resolution of individual mobility reveals shared routine behaviors that underscore the importance of diverse social collaborations in forming complex polities in the South Caucasus.",

    "description": "The causes, consequences, and timing of the rise of moralizing religions in world history have been the focus of intense debate. Progress has been limited by the availability of quantitative data to test competing theories, by divergent ideas regarding both predictor and outcomes variables, and by differences of opinion over methodology. To address all these problems, we utilize Seshat: Global History Databank, a large storehouse of information designed to test theories concerning the evolutionary drivers of social complexity in world history. In addition to the Big Gods hypothesis, which proposes that moralizing religion contributed to the success of increasingly large-scale complex societies, we consider the role of warfare, animal husbandry, and agricultural productivity in the rise of moralizing religions. Using a broad range of new measures of belief in moralizing supernatural punishment, we find strong support for previous research showing that such beliefs did not drive the rise of social complexity in world history. By contrast, our analyses indicate that intergroup warfare, supported by resource availability, played the most significant role in the evolution of both social complexity and moralizing religions. Thus, the correlation between social complexity and moralizing religion would seem to result from shared evolutionary drivers, rather than from strong direct causal relationships between these two variables. The data, methods, and results presented in this paper have been made publicly available online for others to inspect and critique, allowing additional analyses to be run and alternative assumptions to be tested, prior to peer review and publication.",

    "description": "In philosophy, and especially in ethics, reflective equilibrium (RE) is often considered a powerful method for obtaining beliefs that mutually support each other, are justified by evidence, and are backed by good reasons. Beisbart, Betz, and Brun (2021) have introduced a formal model of reflective equilibrium based on the theory of dialectical structures Betz (2013), which they use as a methodological tool to understand the method of reflective equilibrium better. This report is an outcome of the research project 'How far does Reflective Equilibrium Take us? Investigating the Power of a Philosophical Method' and summarizes the findings of assessing the model thoroughly by numerical investigation. We simulate RE processes for a broad spectrum of model parameters and initial conditions and use four different model variants (including the original model). We analyze the dependence of simulation results on different parameters and assess the models' conduciveness towards consistency, and ability to reach global optima and full RE states. The results show that the models' behavior depends crucially on the specifics of the simulation setup (e.g., the sentence pool size and $\\alpha$ weights). We can, therefore, not draw any general conclusions about the overall performance of the model variants. Rather, the specifics of the context in which an RE model is used must be considered to choose a specific model. Finally, we identify some critical knowledge gaps we cannot close with this report that call for further research into RE modelling.",

    "description": "The digital revolution has ushered in many societal and economic benefits. Yet access to digital technologies such as mobile phones and internet remains highly unequal, especially by gender in the context of low- and middle-income countries. While national-level estimates are increasingly available for many countries, reliable, quantitative estimates of digital gender inequalities at the subnational level are lacking. These estimates, however, are essential for monitoring gaps within countries and implementing targeted interventions within the global sustainable development goals, which emphasize the need to close inequalities both between and within countries. We develop estimates of internet and mobile adoption by gender and digital gender gaps at the subnational level for 2,158 regions in 118 low- and middle-income countries (LMICs), a context where digital penetration is low and national-level gender gaps disfavoring women are large. We construct these estimates by applying machine-learning algorithms to Facebook user counts, geospatial data, development indicators, and population composition data. We calibrate and assess the performance of these algorithms using ground-truth data from subnationally-representative household survey data from 31 LMICs. Our results reveal striking disparities in access to mobile and internet technologies between and within LMICs, with implications for policy formulation and infrastructure investment. These disparities contribute to a global context where women are 21% less likely to use the internet and 17% less likely to own mobile phones than men, corresponding to over 385 million more men than women owning a mobile phone and over 360 million more men than women using the internet.",

    "description": "Long-term symptoms continuing after a Covid-19 infection have emerged as a complex medical, scientific, and economic problem in numerous societies around the world. Moreover, how this problem is addressed may have important consequences in terms of trust or lack thereof in scientific, medical, and political institutions. Drawing on three studies of patient experiences with Covid-19 recovery in the United States, Brazil, and China, we find significant variation in how patients talk about their condition in the three countries. While American patients embrace Long Covid as a disease identity, Chinese patients were wary of using the term, while Brazilian patients were somewhere between the two. These differences in naming become intelligible within a grid composed of three cross-cutting axes of comparison: (1) the symbolic politics of disease classification and representation; (2) institutionalized channels of healthcare and welfare state provision; and (3) position in the global geopolitical and knowledge production system. We conclude that even if global public health institutions manage to institutionalize Long Covid as a standard disease category, there will remain significant differences between countries in the meaning and scope of the condition due to the differences in the politics of expertise in each country.",

Among those low in engagement, NSC is directly related to left-leaning economic preferences, since social welfare can be regarded as insurance. Among those high in engagement, NSC predicts right-wing economic preferences, since engaged individuals high in NSC take cues from right-leaning elites suggesting that support for redistribution is inconsistent with conservative political identities. Examining comparative European public opinion, we argue that this \u2018reversal\u2019 is less applicable to universal basic income (UBI), since the latter is an unconditional benefit that detaches welfare provision from specific situations of risk (e.g., unemployment insurance). This should shift individuals to think of provision in terms of moral hazard (e.g., work avoidance) in the context of UBI. Using Round 8 of the European Social Survey, we test and find support for several hypotheses based on this argument.",

    "link": "https://share.osf.io/preprint/E0253-57F-605",
    "description": "Background: A recent development in bioarchaeology is the big-data approach. This comes with the production of pan-continental and/or multiregional databases of bioarchaeological information, such as isotope, osteological, ancient DNA (aDNA), and radiocarbon data (14C). There are significant advantages in this approach, including the availability of large datasets of scientific data. The big-data approach, however, also faces challenges, which we address through MARGA\u2014the MARGinality in Archaeology database. Data: MARGA is a database we built for the study of marginality in the past, a topic of growing interest in bioarchaeology. Currently, MARGA includes ~1000 human individuals and ~3000 associated specimens, such as objects and faunal remains. It covers two main regions in Italy, c.1200 BC\u201325 AD: Veneto in the northeast, and the Apennine mountain range in the centre-south. MARGA gathers osteological, archaeological, taphonomic, and isotope data (\u03b413C, \u03b415N, \u03b418O and 87Sr/86Sr). This is accompanied by contextual information on chronology, geography, zooarchaeology, palaeobotany, epigraphy, and scholarly literature. Methods: MARGA was built as an Access relational database with a main table where we stored information on the sampled human burials (table 1: Fig. 1). This table provided a path to three secondary tables with accompanying information on osteology (table 2), material culture (table 3) and isotope data (table 4). Data were sampled from existing scientific literature, archaeological reports, and raw datasets we produced ourselves. Access afforded storing and querying both numerical and textual information. Statistical and contextual analyses on the sampled data addressed variables such as ritual, burial practice, nutrition, mobility, provenance, palaeopathology, and palaeoecology. In building and querying the database, we also developed a critical assessment and contextual analysis of MARGA\u2019s features. This afforded broader considerations on the construction, implementation and reuse of databases in bioarchaeology, evolutionary biology, and cognate disciplines. Results: Querying MARGA generated new insights into marginality in late prehistoric and early Roman Italy, which illuminated lifeways, human-environment interactions, and burial practices in the study areas. We summarize such knowledge advances in the article. In addition, MARGA provided a case study on opportunities and challenges in harnessing big data in bioarchaeology. We, therefore, identified constraints and directions for future research which, we anticipate, will shape developments in big-data initiatives. We drew inferences on issues concerning i) terminology in data categorization; ii) the impact of increasingly sophisticated analytical methods in bioarchaeology; iii) data reuse; and iv) ethics. As regards analytical methods, we provided three examples building on osteological, isotope and taphonomic data in MARGA. Conclusion: This study produced new knowledge on the lifeways of marginalized communities and the social meaning of inhumation, in different ecosystems of Italy c.1200 BC\u201325 AD. The study also showed that cutting-edge developments in bioarchaeology are multiplying and diversifying exponentially the data available for sampling and storage: this will impinge on the future evolution and fruition of databases. We determined that MARGA itself can be updated with the deposition of novel data for open research, and querying, which would bring these issues to the fore. Ultimately, we identified a dichotomy in the conceptualization of databases. If they are treated as finished products when published open access, they risk becoming obsolete as new data are produced. If, however, they are considered evolving projects constantly morphing and in flux, a ramification of complex issues arises around, for example, sustainability, access, ethics, technology, funding, and labour. MARGA, therefore, contributes towards conceptual groundworks in the wider big-data movement in bioarchaeology and cognate disciplines, while addressing limitations in evidence and methods.",

We particularly examine regulatory trends in granting MAR access to single women and lesbian couples in Europe, and how legislation aligns with attitudes towards single motherhood and same-sex parenthood. Utilizing descriptive analysis and two-level models on original MAR legislation data across 36 European countries and the European Values Study (2008\u201310 and 2017\u201320) for attitudes, we show that MAR access is granted to lesbian couples in contexts where same-sex parenthood is accepted. By contrast, legalized MAR access for single women seems rather disconnected from public opinion towards single motherhood. As a whole, the paper delineates contexts in which the combination of social acceptance and legal permissibility of MAR use for non-normative prospective parents may favor the formation of \u2018new\u2019 family forms.",

    "description": "Importance: Issues related to social connection are increasingly recognised as a global public health priority. However, there is a lack of a holistic understanding of social connection and its health impacts as most empirical research focuses on a single or few individual concepts of social connection. Objective: To explore patterns of social connection and their relationship with health and wellbeing outcomes. Design: Observational study using machine learning cluster analysis and regression analysis. Setting: England. Participants: Our analytical sample included 7,706 participants aged 50 or above from the forth wave of the English Longitudinal Study of Aging (2008-2009). Exposure: social connection clusters informed by the cluster analysis. Main Outcomes and Measures: This study considered a number of outcomes related to mental health (depression), hedonic (life satisfaction, pleasure) and eudaimonic (self-realisation) wellbeing, general health (self-reported health) and health behaviour (moderate or vigorous physical activity). We controlled for a number of key confounders identified using directed acyclic graphs, including age, sex, ethnicity, education, social class and wealth. Results: Among 7,706 participants, the mean age was 64.7 (SD=9.6) and 54.9% were females. We identified five clusters including: the highly connected (33.0%), disconnected (12.6%), gapped structure & poor function (14.4%), gapped structure & high function (20.5%) and poor function & mixed quality (19.5%) clusters. All clusters had poorer outcomes compared to the highly connected cluster. The difference was smallest between the highly connected and gapped structure & high function clusters across most outcomes.",

The primary motivation for this study is to shed light on the conceptual use and potential applicability of the path dependence framework in the field of collective memory research. Drawing on the scientific history of the dissemination and diffusion of the path dependence concept across disciplinary boundaries and academic debates, the paper underscores the importance of clarifying its theoretical underpinnings. It also examines the diffusion of the concept and the resulting diversification of its interpretations. Subsequently, the paper explores potential applications in the field of collective memory studies. Additionally, the paper raises critical questions concerning the possible challenges and implications associated with integrating the concept into memory research, particularly in relation to the phenomenon of 'conceptual stretching.'",

    "description": "This paper examines the 2022 Australian federal election coverage on WeChat for Australian audiences. We analyzed 3,462 public articles collected during May 2021 to May 2022 from 135 WeChat news services called WeChat Official Accounts (with 99 remaining active by the time of analysis). We found that diasporic Chinese media accounts had a more prominent role in shaping online discourses compared to China-based media accounts, Australia-based business accounts, or Australian politicians\u2019 accounts. In reporting the 2022 Australian federal election, COVID-19 policies, the economy, immigration, and international relations with particular regard to Australia-China relations, were common themes. Our findings reveal the formation of a \u201ctranslational news ecology\u201d that bridges diasporic media to Australia\u2019s English-speaking, mainstream public sphere which is primarily shaped by Australian national media and politicians.

We present results from a conjoint experimental study of a large-scale sample of the Japanese public, in which we estimate how much salary and benefits workers are willing to trade for best-in-practice harassment protections. We find that women are 6 percentage points more likely to prefer firms with anonymous, third-party harassment reporting systems compared to other firms, and they also negatively value workplaces with no sexual harassment reporting mechanism equivalently to a workplace with a 20% lower wage. Men also negatively value poor sexual harassment reporting mechanisms, but they are more willing to trade wages for better workplace bullying (\"power harassment\") reporting systems. These findings suggest that workers are willing to pay for harassment reporting systems, and that companies may better attract talent by adopting these reporting schemes.",

Analyzing current decarbonization strategies, their effectiveness, and the role of corporate commitment and risk management offers insights needed to identify development paths in the current environment characterized by pressure driven by stringent environmental standards and fierce competition. An empirical approach, including a survey model and simulation, is used to answer prominent research questions. Aspects such as the influence of environmental and governance criteria, specific initiatives that can be undertaken, the importance of corporate commitment, and the integration of risk management into strategic planning are examined. Simulations suggest that the probability of meeting the 2030 goals range from 65.08 to 75.98 percent and the delta between low and high commitment ranges from 4.917 to 4.133 percent according to the share of renewables in the energy mix decarbonization. The influence of the energy mix is also included in the analysis. The research highlights the need for greater coordination and commitment across the industry to improve decarbonization efforts. It emphasizes the critical role of government policies and market dynamics in shaping industry actions toward achieving decarbonization goals.

    "description": "This paper examines the role of the middle classes in processes of reinvestment in two neighborhoods in Santiago, Chile (\u00d1u\u00f1oa) and Buenos Aires, Argentina (San Telmo). These cities have inspired a significant gentrification literature. Yet, far from a uniform or inevitable process, the article suggests that regionally specific class meanings shape the residential choices of the middle-classes. Drawing on economic and cultural sociology, we show that housing choices are infused with status competitions that result in symbolic returns and shape the trajectory of neighborhoods. New high-rise development remains a potent symbol of middle-class status in these contexts, yet fewer residents are drawn to older housing markets or the former housing of the urban poor. The result is a highly contextual gentrification trajectory. Much of the residential and commercial development in \u00d1u\u00f1oa and San Telmo resulted from state policies rather than market dynamics. In both communities, to some degree, it was more common for middle class residents to be priced out rather than low-income residents being physically displaced to renovate housing for a local middle class. The two cases also offer evidence of middle-class collective action, with existing middle-class residents more likely to oppose development despite personal, material, and symbolic gains.",

    "description": "This study explores the evolutionary advantages of workplace gender equality using a simulation-based approach. Through an agent-based model, it contrasts the performance of societies adhering to two selection strategies: performance-based and equality-based, in scenarios with and without inherent sex disadvantages. The findings reveal that the equality approach, which ensures equal representation of sexes in job selections, accelerates societal performance evolution, outpacing the performance-only strategy even when sex-based disadvantages are factored in. This advantage is most pronounced in the early generations, highlighting the long-term benefits of gender equality policies in the workplace. The results underscore the importance of implementing gender equality measures in the workplace, not just as a matter of fairness but as a strategic advantage for societal advancement. This work suggests that policies enforcing workplace equality could offer unrecognized long-term benefits, urging a reevaluation of current approaches and encouraging further research to address its limitations and explore the broader implications of gender equality in evolving societies.",

    "description": "Background. A highly pathogenic strain of avian influenza (H5N1, or \u201cbird flu\u201d) began circulating across poultry farms worldwide in 2020. While the virus has been transmitted to mammals and humans in the past, media attention to the potential impact of H5N1 on human health following the documentation of unprecedented transmission between mammals in Spring 2024; including the prevalence of H5N1 in the commercial dairy supply. Objective. To quantify (a) the prevalence and (b) socio-political correlates (e.g., partisan identity, attitudes toward scientific expertise) of public concern about H5N1, as well as support for policy action aimed at reducing its potential risks to human health. Method. In a nationally representative longitudinal survey of N = 831 US adults, we asked respondents to answer a series of questions about the levels of concern about H5N1 transmission to humans, beliefs about the safety of consuming unpasteurized milk products, and support for government interventions aimed at reducing the public health risks posed by avian influenza outbreaks. Results. We find that a small minority of Americans express concern about the public health risks of H5N1, or reject misinformation about the safety of raw milk consumption. Low levels of concern and raw milk misinformation are in turn associated with opposition to policies aimed at reducing the public health risks borne by H5N1, as is both anti-intellectual attitude endorsement and partisan identification with the Republican Party. Conclusions. Public apathy about the public health risks borne by avian flu \u2013 and corresponding indifferences toward mitigating policy action \u2013 could undermine US pandemic preparedness. Lacking clear signals from the public to take action to address this important issue, policymakers may be reluctant to pursue policies that reduce avian influenza\u2019s pandemic potential.",

    "description": "There has been a major crackdown from the Hajj Administration this year (2024) on pilgrims performing the Hajj without a permit. The Hajj pilgrimage, one of the five pillars of the Islamic faith, continues to draw millions of devotees annually, despite the significant sacrifices, risks, and discomforts faced by those who journey without official permits. This paper delves into the underlying motives and compounded complexities driving pilgrims to undertake the Hajj without permit, examining factors such as spiritual obligation, economic barriers, and limited accessibility. By unraveling underpinning issues, the study sheds light on the shortcomings of the existing infrastructure and urban setup, which fuel the persistent demand for unauthorized Hajj participation. It emphasizes integrating past insights and present-day realities, to draw a holistic urban strategy to manage pilgrim influx sustainably while fostering economic opportunities. The proposed model advocates for interdisciplinary collaboration and community engagement to refine urban planning, preserve cultural heritage, and enhance the pilgrimage experience. Ultimately, this approach aims to ensure Makkah's continued role as a spiritual hub while addressing the evolving needs of pilgrims and residents alike.",

Oligopticons are networked devices and their supporting infrastructures that render the city in extremely narrow but very clear representations, in this case as a city of waste hotspots. In Rotterdam, public management is designing data-hungry oligopticons that map, control and intervene in the illegal disposal of waste and litter. An analysis of two vignettes from the author\u2019s ethnographic fieldwork finds that these oligopticons do more than simply make visible and control these practices of waste disposal: they instead engage in a punitive politics that frames those who illegally dispose of waste as exception to a normalizing way of life, fighting not waste but difference. Through ethnographic comparison, this paper aims to evoke thought, imagination and reflection in readers regarding the consequences of infrastructures of surveillance and control, and to the intimate knowledges that may escape these infrastructures.",

    "description": "The academic discipline of sociology is divided methodologically and theoretically, which has long been a source of consternation as well as celebration. In this paper we describe the state of actually existing sociology as practiced in PhD-granting departments, by analyzing all dissertation abstracts from U.S. sociology departments archived at ProQuest from 2020 through early 2024 (N=1872) using natural language processing methods (Keyword Assisted Topic Models with Latent Dirichelet Allocation). Results show that more dissertations (64%) use qualitative than quantitative (47%) methods. Where geographic scope is identified, most focus on U.S.topics. The most common substantive topics are inequality, broadly defined (58%), followed by economic subjects (46%), race (37%), politics and health (35% each). The most pervasive difference concerns qualitative versus quantitative approaches. For example, qualitative methods are most common in organizations and movements (79%), and least common in life course (43%) and children and youth studies (54%). Quantitative methods are most associated with life course (61%) and ethnicity (59%), and least common in social movements (34%). Finally, using gender probabilities based on given names, we find that average female representation is somewhat higher in qualitative studies (61%) than quantitative (56%) studies, but subject of study matters more, with the average probability of female authorship highest in gender (72%) and family (66%) studies, and lowest in urban studies (52%). Women are more concentrated in qualitative than quantitative studies across almost all subject areas, but the differences are relatively small, so that gender divisions appear to be driven more by subjects of study than by methodological approaches.

When the researcher seeking access is a criminology practitioner and that access is being sought from a criminal, the process of attempting to build trust and rapport, especially when the opportunity to engage presents itself by chance, is complicated. This ethnographic account outlines the process of such an encounter, balancing accountability to profession whilst simultaneously seeking to operationalise the theoretical intertwining of the criminology practitioner and independent academic researcher status. The duality of these seemingly opposite roles of this specific encounter is contrasted by the creative opportunity of cultural criminology\u2019s methodological approach of verstehen. Techniques of impression management to elicit a favourable response were fluid and evolving, recognising when one approach was failing and changing direction to pursue another. This approach needed to coexist and compliment the disposal of the criminological encounter from a practitioner control agent perspective. This was achieved by the use of discretion. Limited success was gained post interaction with a potential channel of communication elicited by a third party for possible access to the field, although there is no certainty of this.",

    "description": "This essay provides an answer to the question ``What is digitalization policy?'', through the lens of policy integration. To do so, I introduce a core distinction between naive and encompassing understandings of digitalization policy. Then, I posit that digitalization policy does not have a singular policy domain but rather distributed impacts across different policy domains. Digitalization policy is therefore always policy integration. Combining this assertion with an encompassing understanding of digitalization policy, I arrive at a modern definition of digitalization policy as any policy that targets the direct regulation of digital communication and digital infrastructure, in conjunction with the impact of such regulation on any affected policy domain(s). From this perspective, I argue that drivers of digitalization policy can be found in established groups of drivers of policy integration, based on institutions, interests or ideas. The essay suggests a blueprint for constructively approaching research on policy related to digitalization. It concludes with an illustrative application of the blueprint to an empirical example of a digitalization policymaking process in Switzerland, a policy sprint on the contribution of artificial intelligence to sustainability.",

We expand on this research by examining the economic arguments deployed by both opponents and proponents of climate mitigation in the debates over the Kyoto Protocol from 1997-2001. Through an analysis of 790 articles in three national newspapers alongside key documents, we find that the dominant economic framing contrasted competing claims about the cost of mitigation (whether it would have a large or small impact on the American economy). In contrast, virtually no actors - including proponents - argued that Kyoto would provide substantial benefits to the US in terms of reduced climate impacts, in part because prominent economic models ignored those impacts or assumed them to be small. This analysis suggests that mainstream economic expertise may have contributed to the failure of the United States to implement substantial climate policy.",

Such manuscripts were identified based on their content, as they include expositions of the Creed, the Lord\u2019s Prayer and the mass, baptismal instructions, and descriptions of clerical grades. This article shows that the presence of material from books VI-VIII of the Etymologiae of Isidore of Seville, in particular De officiis (Etym. VI 19) and De clericis (Etym. VII 12), also characterizes Carolingian manuscripts for priests. It identifies four well-attested Carolingian catechetic collections assembled from excerpts from Isidore\u2019s works to serve as instructional manuals for priests. These collections originated in northern France in the last decades of the eighth or the first decades of the ninth century and appear connected to Carolingian correctio. The paper also identifies other Isidorean catechetic collections surviving in a single manuscript and excerpt collections whose intended use by priests cannot be fully substantiated. These compilations of Isidorean excerpts attest to a shift in the perception of the Etymologiae under the influence of the reforms, namely its reinvention as a didactic resource, despite Isidore\u2019s intended use of the text as an encyclopaedia.",

    "link": "https://share.osf.io/preprint/E0103-9B6-400",
    "description": "The Etymologiae of Isidore of Seville was one of the most widely read works of the early Middle Ages, as is evidenced by the number of surviving manuscripts. August Eduard Anspach\u2019s handlist from the 1940s puts their number at almost 1,200, of which approximately 300 were estimated to have been copied before the year 1000. This article, based on a new manuscript survey of the early medieval manuscripts transmitting the Etymologiae, brings the number of known surviving pre-1000 manuscripts transmitting the Etymologiae to almost 450. Of these, 84 well-preserved codices and 24 fragments contain the canonical Etymologiae, i.e., they reflect the integral transmission of Isidore\u2019s work as an encyclopedia, while 300 well-preserved codices and 21 fragments reflect the selective or non-canonical transmission of the Etymologiae, principally not as an encyclopedia. Due to the uneven survival rates of manuscripts of canonical and non-canonical Etymologiae, it seems likely that the latter accounted for perhaps as much as 80-90% of manuscripts transmitting Isidore\u2019s work before the year 1000. Four non-canonical formats emerge as having been particularly influential in the early Middle Ages: the separate transmission of the first book of the Etymologiae as an ars grammatica; the compilation of various catechetical collections, sometimes in question-and-answer form, from books VI, VII, and VIII of the Etymologiae; the incorporation of material from books V and IX into law collections; and the incorporation of segments from books III, V, VI, and XIII into computistic manuals. The surviving manuscripts suggest that the latter format emerged in the insular world, while the others are more distinctly Carolingian. Northern France and northern Italy emerge as the two most important regional hubs of the copying of the Etymologiae in the ninth and tenth centuries. While in the former region, non-canonical formats seem to have been the most important vehicle of the transmission of material from Isidore\u2019s work, in the latter, the canonical format may have been more influential, indicating that there existed regional differences in the reception of the Etymologiae.",

    "description": "Besides glosses and other textual annotations, early medieval Latin manuscript commonly feature technical signs, annotation symbols and sigla that reflect readership or provide a framework for interpretation and use. The early medieval Insular book users were particularly keen on using such devices. This article maps the usage of technical signs in a corpus of early medieval Irish manuscripts produced on the Continent or preserved and used there early after the production. In the center of the inquiry are four manuscripts belonging to an Irish scholarly circle associated with Sedulius Scottus. The article concludes that: * Insular, and specifically Irish, annotators used a specific repertoire of technical signs; * This Insular/Irish repertoire is substantially distinct from the repertoire of technical signs used by Carolingian scribes and therefore allows for discerning books annotated by Insular/Irish users on the Continent; * A noticeable difference exists between various identifiable clusters of manuscripts annotated by Insular/Irish users, suggesting that different annotators and circles drew on different parts of the Insular repertoire; * The manuscripts from the Sedulius group stand out from among other Irish books produced on the Continent on account of the specific mode of annotation, which seems to have been particular to the circle of scholars that produced them; * The Greek Psalter of Sedulius, which contains the subscription of Sedulius Scottus, displays a pattern of sign use distinct from the one found in the manuscripts from the Sedulius group and therefore does not seem related to them; * One or two lightly-annotated manuscripts contain traces of annotation in the manner of the Sedulius circle and therefore may reflect activities of the scholars from this scholarly group.",

    "description": "In recent decades, sustainability has emerged as a central theme in addressing future uncertainties, intertwined with discourses on ecology, conservation, resilience and socio-ecological justice. While much scholarly attention has focused on sustainability in industrial production, design, global development and lifestyles, the relationship between sustainability and basic research remains underexplored. This paper addresses this gap by examining how sustainability concerns are integrated into scientific practice, specifically within basic research in science and engineering. Through a collaborative ethnographic research process within an interdisciplinary initiative at the University of Technology Dresden, we explore how sustainability and basic research can inform one another. Our analysis draws on qualitative methods, including interviews and group discussions and is grounded in perspectives from sociology, anthropology and Science and Technology Studies (STS), particularly valuation studies. We investigate the various meanings of sustainability as invoked in the appraisal and evaluation of basic research, pursuing the question: What is valued when basic research is deemed \u2018sustainable\u2019? Our findings are organized around four central themes: sustainability as efficiency, sustainability through flexibility, sustainability assessment as estimation and sustainability assessment as finding leverage. These themes reveal the complexities and challenges of appraising basic research in terms of sustainability.",

    "description": "We take the case of desired residential mobility during the pandemic with the intent of going beyond understanding the pandemic as disruption, framing it instead as creative destruction. By revisiting Joseph Schumpeter\u2019s classic thesis, we transpose its economic into a social vocabulary of new \u2018lifeforms\u2019, \u2018mutations\u2019 and \u2018wants\u2019 that innovative agents\u2013movers, in our case\u2013enact in their quest for the \u2018good life\u2019/\u2018good home\u2019. Drawing on 77 qualitative questionnaires, we examine how urban-to-rural and urban-to-urban movers negotiated the pull-and-push factors of relocation, and to what extent changing house fits a model of lifestyle change. Proposing the metaphor of \u2018privileged mutations\u2019, we cast urban-to-rural moves as lasting and thorough creative destructions: old housing wants are rendered obsolete and \u2018revolutionary\u2019 new ones are being created, a process which may set in motion a second creative destruction, that of place. However, the landscape of residential mobility during the pandemic also comprises quiet transformations driven by a quest for home comfort that those relatively privileged have always pursued along life-course while remaining attached to the buzz of urban life. Observing the rich potential and underuse of the Schumpeterian perspective in social sciences, we invite scholars to consider its explanatory power in future research.",

    "description": "Conventional wisdom surrounding President Joe Biden\u2019s unprecedented decision to exit the 2024 Presidential race suggests that he came to view his would-be nomination as detrimental for the Democratic Party; both with respect to turnout, as well as the success of \u201cdown-ballot\u201d candidates for federal and state-wide office. Whether or not conventional wisdom is correct, however, remains an open question. The answer to this question can help shed light on whether or not the president\u2019s electoral calculus, and the calculi of those who may one day find themselves in a similar position, is likely to be effective. We answer this question by studying a naturally occurring experiment surrounding the President\u2019s decision to exit the race; a period in which we happened to be fielding the second wave (NWave 2 = 831) of a nationally representative two-wave panel study (NWave 1 = 1,400), with invitation assignment randomly assigned (from the original response pool) throughout Wave 2 survey administration. Pre-registered difference-in-difference (DID) analyses reveal no evidence of significant turnout or down-ballot effects across either the US adult population or partisan subgroups. However, post hoc tests reveal substantial gains in excitement about the 2024 campaign across both the general population and (especially) among self-identified Democrats. We conclude by discussing the lessons learned from the one-of-a-kind dataset, and potential limitations of this research.",

    "description": "Critical scholars have long called for state recognition of de facto families, beyond legal or biological ties, as a pathway towards inclusion of more diverse family forms. This article asks to which extent recognition of de facto families indeed leads to more inclusion, in the context of a restrictive immigration regime where families need state permission to live together. It zooms in on migration law practice in the Netherlands, through an analysis of laws and regulations, work instructions of street level implementers, and interviews with migration lawyers. It finds that conceptions of family-as-doing which focus on practices of dependency and care play a small but significant role in Dutch migration law, enabling inclusion of families beyond the nuclear model. However, recognition of de facto families may lead to new forms of state scrutiny of intimate lives, as well as to new forms of exclusion.",

This paper reports on the results of implementing our diagnostic multiple-choice assessments in a College Algebra course over a three year span. Quantitative and qualitative analysis suggests these assessments associate student knowledge with their choices and thus can be used as practical diagnostic tools.

    "description": "Sociologists are often interested in estimating and testing whether some causal effect varies by a modifier of interest. The conventional regression estimator for effect modification is inflexible in functional form and prone to misspecification bias. Machine Learning (ML) algorithms can aid the estimation of effect modification in observational studies by controlling for confounders in a highly flexible, automated, yet principled way. Therefore, leveraging ML for effect modification helps reduce misspecification bias and enhance the credibility of causal identification. We introduce a novel estimator that estimates effect modification in a familiar regression framework after using ML algorithms to fit nuisance components of the model. We show that this estimator is more flexible than the conventional regression model while more efficient and suitable for theory-driven sociological research than other ML-based methods. We use the new estimator to study the modification in the effect of a college degree on adult family income by gender and family income in adolescence in the United States. Along these two dimensions, the benefits of a college degree are rather equally distributed.",

    "description": "In general, support for gender equality and LGBTIQ+ has increased in the past decades. Cur-rent studies suggest a broad overall endorsement. However, gender-related issues have become increasingly politicized and publicly contested in recent years. Especially the political and media debate has intensified and right-wing populist and radical right parties campaign against a so-called \u201cgenderism\u201d. Against this backdrop, a common perception is that all kinds of is-sues revolving around gender conflate into a single, overarching discourse about gender and sexuality that is antagonistically polarized between a supportive and a dismissive camp. What remains unclear is whether this form of discursive polarization on gender-related issues reso-nates with public opinion. Based on data from the German Social Cohesion Panel from 2022, we can show that there is a need to differentiate the debate and conceptually separate two distinct dimensions of gender issues: while binary issues, i.e. issues that concern equality be-tween men and women, receive overwhelming support from the German population, non-heteronormative issues, i.e. issues that concern LGBTIQ+, are viewed with great skepticism. Accordingly, due to the high support of binary gender issues, there hardly seems to be any room for political mobilization on them. This is completely different with regard to non-heteronormative issues. Right-wing populist parties like the German AfD stand out in attract-ing voters who oppose the promotion of equality for gender and sexual minorities.",

The data consist of qualitative online survey responses from 1011 runners and were analyzed via abductive content analysis. As a result, we identified three dispositional frames (running for training, health and recreation, and sociality) and three technological frames (technology as verificator, motivator, and safeguard), the combinations of which highlight the often multifaceted, layered, and situational relationship people have with recreational running and technology use.",

Limited research on interventions in media reporting of gambling harm complicates the development of best practices for reporting guidelines. This scoping review explored research on media guidelines for stigmatised conditions, including substance use, mental ill health, suicidality, and poverty. Databases searched included PubMed, Scopus, and Web of Science, alongside grey literature from Google and targeted organisation websites. Two reviewers screened titles, abstracts, and full texts, with extracted data analysed descriptively.

Effective implementation requires training, stakeholder collaboration, and continuous feedback, while challenges include balancing journalistic freedom with ethical considerations and contextual adaptation. The review identified essential elements in current news media guidelines for the selected conditions, highlighting that collaboration among media professionals, public health practitioners, and lived experience communities is crucial.

    "description": "While research emphasized the risk of gendered sample selection bias among the elderly decades ago, the empirical literature on old-age inequalities remains largely unaware of it. This research note addresses this issue by investigating gendered sample selectivity for individuals aged 65 or older employing two common sample criteria: self-reported retirement status and pension receipt in countries covered by the Survey of Health, Ageing, and Retirement in Europe (SHARE). Findings show that more than half of older women are excluded when these criteria are applied. Gender selection bias varies widely across countries and is less pronounced in post-socialist or social-democratic welfare states. Visualizing work trajectories by sample status reveals that women with long unpaid care work periods and men with high self-employment, unemployment, and extended education levels are particularly likely to be excluded. Studies employing such sample criteria risk underestimating gender inequalities in pensions, health, and life satisfaction. The implications are severe for Southern, conservative, and liberal welfare states, and for cross-country comparisons, where sample bias often goes undetected due to its variability across contexts. While this article cannot offer a universal recommendation for sample definitions, it aims to promote less biased sample conceptualizations in studies of the elderly population.",

These two leading authors\u2019 conflicting views are clearly documented in four chapters in Hon and Rakover\u2019s 2001 book: \u201cExplanation: Theoretical approaches and applications\u201d. After a detailed analysis of the differences between Lipton\u2019s and Salmon\u2019s views, three rival potential explanations of Lipton\u2019s and Salmon\u2019s differences\u2014from three different scholars, one being Lipton\u2014are also discussed. Then, based on an empirical test, the explanation advocated in this paper\u2014which is inspired by Thaler\u2019s work on behavioral economics\u2014is selected as best. That explanation is that Lipton\u2019s arguments in favour of IBE provide a strong behavioral explanation of how human beings (Humans) actually draw inferences, whereas Salmon\u2019s views provide a rational normative Bayesian position on how non-demonstrative inferences should be made (by Rational Analysts, or RatAns for short). It is suggested that the cause of the difference in decision making processes used by Humans (compared to RatAns) is that Human inference making processes are the result of millions of years of evolution of our brains, and are therefore probably different to, and less reliable than, rational expert analysis of the probabilities involved, as found in Bayesianism.",

People moving to regional cities and towns favour being close to the coast and having easy access to larger cities while also having a warmer and wetter climate. New AHURI research examines the place-based factors (i.e. that may be specific to a place) that influence people moving to and from Australian regional areas and considers policy solutions for managing the impacts of these changes. Growth is positively related to connectivity, such as by being close to major railways, roads, airports and larger cities and employment centres. Internet connection speeds may also be a factor in migration to certain non-metropolitan areas, with technological advancements and favourable economic conditions enabling former city dwellers to telecommute from smaller regional locations. Access to hospitals and available health infrastructure can be significant considerations for people considering moving to a regional city. A key challenge in regional areas is that for vacancies in key employment sectors, local residents may not have requisite skills and attracting key workers from city locations can be challenging as housing challenges, reduced services (i.e. childcare) and other factors of liveability, and lack of job opportunities for a spouse, can be a disincentive.

    "description": "Field education is a significant component of social work education and might be the signature pedagogy. Yet current issues limit the quality of experience that students can receive from practicum. These issues include austerity policies, exhaustion of altruism, trends towards clinical social work and privatized human services, and a lack of student readiness. Degree granting institutions, such as universities, have long relied on altruism to run social work field education programs but austerity measures may mean that historical altruism can no longer be relied upon. The lack of compensation for practicum students and field instructors is unethical and may contribute to conflicts of interest and exploitation in practicum. This article details these present challenges in social work field education through incorporating scholarship and reflection and presents ideas for change. Enhanced orientation and stipends for practicum students and field instructors have shown preliminary promise in mitigating modern social work field education difficulties. For field education to be social work\u2019s signature pedagogy, practicum planning and associated policies must be treated with respect and rigour, constantly scrutinized and improved upon as the field develops and changes.",

    "description": "Das Ziel der vorliegenden Studie ist es, abweichendes Verhalten in der COVID-19 Pandemie zu erkl\u00e4ren und empirisch zu erforschen. Genauer liegt der Fokus auf Determinanten von Impfnachweisf\u00e4lschungen und des L\u00fcgens in Bezug auf den eigenen Impf- und Teststatus. Es werden Daten einer Online-Befragung ausgewertet (n = 549). Mit Blick auf die Erkl\u00e4rung des abweichenden Verhaltens, k\u00f6nnen die aus der Rational Choice Theory abgeleiteten Hypothesen zur Sanktionswahrscheinlichkeit und Sanktionsh\u00f6he empirisch nicht best\u00e4tigt werden. Die Hypothesen zum Einfluss von sozialen Normen sind dagegen robuster. So ist das abweichende Verhalten im eigenen sozialen Umfeld ein guter Pr\u00e4diktor f\u00fcr die eigene Impfnachweisf\u00e4lschung. Zudem verh\u00e4lt sich eine Person eher dann abweichend, wenn sie glaubt, dass sich die Mehrheit der Gesellschaft nicht an Corona-Restriktionen h\u00e4lt. Schlie\u00dflich zeigt die \u00dcberpr\u00fcfung einer Reihe von Einstellungshypothesen, dass das Misstrauen in das Robert Koch-Institut ein robuster Pr\u00e4diktor f\u00fcr die eigene Devianz ist.",

    "description": "Blair et al. (2023) examine the effect of UN peacekeeping on democratization in conflict-affected countries. They use fixed effects and instrumental variable estimators and find evidence that \u201dUN missions with democracy promotion mandates are strongly positively correlated with the quality of democracy in host countries but that the magnitude of the relationship is larger for civilian than for uniformed personnel, stronger when peacekeepers engage rather than bypass host governments when implementing reforms, driven in particular by UN election administration and oversight, and more robust during periods of peace than during periods of civil war\u201d. Since the authors provide an impressive list of robustness checks, we focus on computational and robustness reproducibility. We replicate the findings using the Stata code provided in the replication material and reproduce all main analyses in R. We add year fixed effects to country fixed effects, cluster standard errors, use fixed and random panel regression estimators and ordered Beta regression estimators. We furthermore reproduce instrumental variable estimators with two different packages. We find that the original findings were reproducible and robust.",

    "description": "Building on findings in diverse literatures in political science, economics and psychology, we surmise that an important effect of the steep rise in inequality in the United States may be to undermine popular support for public investment in costly collective goods. We argue that economic inequality may influence perceptions of the: fairness of the political economy system in the broad sense; fairness of the distributive features of a policy on either the tax or spend side; and likelihood of successful delivery of promised policy goals. Via any of these mechanisms, citizens who learn or attend to the fact that they are on the losing side of rising inequality might be expected to become less willing to pay material costs to pay for collective goods. We evaluate the impact of inequality on collective goods support, finding support for our theory in a series of experimental studies",

    "description": "Climatic variability and change disrupt environmental and socioeconomic systems, with widespread implications for human health and wellbeing. A growing demographic literature examines the relationship between climate variability and children\u2019s health and nutritional security in low- and middle-income countries. These impacts may operate through multiple biological and socioeconomic pathways, which provide a strong conceptual basis for expecting climate effects but make the formation of directional hypotheses difficult. These issues are amplified by the potential influence of several selection biases, including from climate-induced mortality. We contribute to this literature by measuring the effects of temperature and precipitation variability on the weight and height of 0-23 month-old (n=362,352) and 24-59 month-old (n=532,497) children, respectively, across 57 developing countries. We measure overall temperature and precipitation effects across the sample and by world region, and test for differences in effects within regions by sex, birth order, mother\u2019s education, and rural (urban) residence. We supplement our analysis of nutrition by fitting models of child mortality, which is an important outcome and a potential source of bias in our health models. We find that recent temperature anomalies are negatively associated with children\u2019s weight-for-height (WHZ) in most regions of the world but early-childhood temperature exposures are positively associated with height-for-age (HAZ). These effects vary only modestly between and within regions, although the lack of overall climate effects on health in Latin America and the Caribbean is notable. Importantly, our models of childhood mortality show that heat exposures are positively associated with mortality risk at all ages and may be especially strong among children ages 24-59 months. These results suggest that estimated climate effects on WHZ and HAZ may be upwardly biased and imply that the apparently positive effects of temperature on HAZ may be in part an artifact of selective mortality.",

    "description": "Scholars have paid minimal attention to the political and practical objectives that guided Tuskegee Institute\u2019s sociological program and institutional interventions in the 19th and 20th centuries. Leveraging a multi-modal, historical sociological approach grounded in primary and secondary analyses of biographical data, narratives, and archival data, I show that Tuskegee\u2019s institutional interventions illustrate three abolitionist tactics: (1) building consciousness through research dissemination and place-based investment, (2) galvanizing Southern whites and political elites to abolish lynching locally, and (3) countering the propaganda used to justify lynching to inspire divestment from lynching and carceral punishment. Booker T. Washington\u2019s commitment to eradicating structural racism and resource deprivation in the aftermath of slavery led to Tuskegee Institute\u2019s formation of the first department of applied rural sociology in the United States, and the Negro Farmers\u2019 conference and Movable School interventions supported a comprehensive anti-poverty strategy. Likewise, the research activism of Monroe Work disseminated via the Negro Year Book and individual publications sought to galvanize the abolition of lynching and carceral punishment. In the wake of re-emerged visibility of white supremacist terrorism and commitments to practicing Du Boisian sociology across the United States, I argue that reviving the memory of Tuskegee\u2019s institutional practices makes a case for reconsidering the place of abolition in academic sociology in the 21st century.",

Second, we adapt and apply an integrative dual systems model of self-regulation as a framework for organising and evaluating the design features found. Our analysis aims to help the design of better tools in two ways: (i) by identifying how, through a well-established model of self-regulation, current tools overlap and differ in how they support self-control; and (ii) by using the model to reveal underexplored cognitive mechanisms that could aid the design of new tools.",

The effects are more pronounced where rural credit is more abundant, property rights are stronger, and gender norms are more unequal. Our findings highlight the unintended consequences of the spread of new technologies on rural asset ownership, underscoring the importance of considering gender disparities in crafting agricultural and climate change strategies.",

    "description": "Objective: To examine young adult women\u2019s and men\u2019s time use for routine housework when moving out of the parental household. Background: From a life-course perspective, establishing an own household is one of the key markers of the transition to adulthood. Leaving home is associated with new responsibilities concerning the organization of everyday life, including housework, and provides a new context for \u201cdoing gender\u201d. Methods: Hours for routine housework were estimated with longitudinal fixed effects regression models, using data from the German Socio-Economic Panel Study (1991\u20132020) on 911 women and 721 men, aged 18\u201332, who moved to an own couple or non-couple household. Results: During the transition to an own household, young adult women increased their time for routine housework by 18 minutes. Young adult men\u2019s increases were larger with 21 minutes. However, the gender gap in routine housework hours widened when young adults moved into couple households but showed a converging pattern when they moved into non-couple households. Conclusion: Women continue to do more housework than men in early adulthood, although moving into non-couple settings tends to decrease gender inequality on average.",

    "description": "Numerous studies into nonviolent resistance have led to a broad but scattered understanding of why some of these movements erupt and succeed, while others do not. This article offers a multilevel framework of analysis to explain trajectories of nonviolent resistance in repressive regimes and illustrates this framework by analysing the potential of Russian domestic nonviolent resistance to the full-scale invasion of Ukraine. The proposed framework incorporates seven overarching factors identified in previous studies, namely the political and economic system, the international relations, the level of modernization, the distribution of power within society, and the grievances, resources and organizational capacity of the resistance group. Based on this framework, it is tentatively concluded that Russia\u2019s political and economic system, the limited power dispersion and the lack of organization among the opposition help to explain why no successful resistance has emerged. Additional case studies are required to further assess the framework\u2019s utility.",

In this article, we develop a new theory on regulation and innovation to reconcile these views, which we test using novel data on federal regulations and the patents of 1,242 firms, from 1994 to 2013.

When asked about \u201cmen\u201d and &#8220;women&#8221; in general, respondents may imagine women (men) with lower (higher) labor market resources. Therefore, standard measures may conflate gender ideologies (injunctive norms) with stereotypical beliefs (descriptive norms). We test this hypothesis with an experiment in the German family panel pairfam: \u223c1,200 respondents rated the appropriate division of housework in \u223c3,700 hypothetical couples. By gradually adding information about labor market resources, we were able to override respondents&#8217; stereotypical beliefs. We find that with more information, even &#8220;traditional&#8221; respondents support egalitarian housework arrangements. The main difference between &#8220;traditional&#8221; and &#8220;egalitarian&#8221; respondents is not in their ideologies (as previously thought), but in their interpretation of vague items. This leads us to conclude that standard measures overestimate traditional gender ideologies.

First, we measured COVID-induced anti-Asian attitudes as the effect of a treatment reminding respondents of the pandemic on whether respondents would be willing to live or work with someone who is East or South Asian. The results suggest that the COVID-19 treatment worsened attitudes toward East and South Asians in the social domain and toward East Asians in the economic domain in 2020, but not in 2022. Second, we measured change in general attitudes toward Asians by comparing the control group responses in 2020 and 2022. The results demonstrate that, over the same period, general attitudes toward Asians have not improved despite growing attention toward anti-Asian biases. This finding underscores the persistence of general negative attitudes toward Asians beyond the immediate context of the pandemic and the ongoing imperative to actively address deeply ingrained biases against Asians.\n\nClose\n\n\n\n\nAbstract Citation",

Identifying if their assessments are fair or biased by student-ascribed status is critical for equal opportunity but empirically challenging, with mixed previous findings. We test status characteristics beliefs, statistical  discrimination, and cultural capital theories with a pre-registered factorial experiment on a large sample of Spanish pre-service teachers (n = 1, 717). This design causally identifies, net of ability, the impact of student-ascribed characteristics on teacher short- and long-term assessments, improving prior studies&#8217; theory testing, confounding, and power. Findings unveil teacher bias in an essay grading task favoring girls and highbrow cultural capital, aligning with status characteristics and cultural capital theories. Results on teachers&#8217; long-term expectations indicate statistical discrimination against boys, migrant origin, and working-class students under uncertain information. Unexpectedly, ethnic discrimination changes from teachers favoring native origin in long-term expectations to migrant origin in short-term evaluations, suggesting compensatory grading. We discuss the complex roots of discrimination in teacher assessments as an educational (in)equality mechanism.\n\nClose\n\n\n\n\nAbstract Citation",

This study examines how such tools influence child welfare governance, using a quasi-experimental design and data from more than one million maltreatment investigations in 121 US counties. It demonstrates that the adoption of PRM tools reduced maltreatment confirmations among Hispanic and Black children but increased such confirmations among high-risk and low-SES children. PRM tools did not reduce the likelihood of subsequent maltreatment confirmations; and effects were heterogeneous across counties. These findings demonstrate that the use of PRM tools can reduce the incidence of state interventions among historically over-represented minorities while increasing it among poor children more generally. However, they also illustrate that the impact of such tools depends on local contexts and that technological innovations do not meaningfully address chronic state interventions in family life that often characterize the lives of vulnerable children.\n\nClose\n\n\n\n\nAbstract Citation",

    "description": "Peter McMahan, Eran Shor\nSociological Science August 20, 2024\n10.15195/v11.a25\n\n\n\nAbstract\n\nSociologists of culture have long noted that contrasting cultural frames can lead to status ambiguity and status multiplicity. We explore these phenomena in the domain of professional sports by first replicating and then extending and challenging recently published findings on selections for the National Basketball Association (NBA) All-Star game. Relying on a large data set that includes more than 10,000 player\u2013years, we show that accounting for better-justified performance measures reduces but does not nullify the effects of status cumulative advantage on All-Star selections. However, when replacing All-Star selections with a less ambiguous measure (selections to All-NBA teams), we no longer find evidence of decoupling between player performance and award nomination. From this we conclude that cumulative status advantage only affects selection when voters view factors other than statistical performance as legitimate, perhaps even desired, selection criteria. These findings have relevance for our understanding of status evaluations beyond professional sports, including in domains as diverse as the film industry, the performing arts, literature, politics, and the sciences.\n\nClose\n\n\n\n\nAbstract Citation",

    "description": "Ursina Kuhn, Debra Hevenstone, Leen Vandecasteele, Samin Sepahniya, Dorian Kessler\nSociological Science August 16, 2024\n10.15195/v11.a24\n\n\n\nAbstract\n\nWe investigate how unemployment insurance generosity impacts reemployment and economic precarity by family type. With Swiss longitudinal administrative data and a regression discontinuity design using potential benefit duration, we examine differences between single households and primary and secondary or equal earners, as well as differences by gender and presence of children. Less generous unemployment insurance (shorter potential benefit duration) speeds up reemployment for all family types during the period with benefit cuts whereas longer-term effects are stronger for single households, secondary and equal earners, and those without children. Economic precarity increases for singles, single-parents, and primary earners during the period with lower benefits though there are no long-term effects. We argue that those with higher financial responsibility (i.e., primary earners or those with children) face pressure to find jobs irrespective of benefit generosity whereas those with lower financial responsibility (i.e., secondary or equal earners and those without children) have more capacity to react.\n\nClose\n\n\n\n\nAbstract Citation",

    "link": "https://sociologicalscience.com/articles-v11-23-626/",
    "description": "Lauren A. Rivera, Katherine Weisshaar, Andr\u00e1s Tilcsik\nSociological Science August 13, 2024\n10.15195/v11.a23\n\n\n\nAbstract\n\nExtensive research reveals employer biases against workers with career disruptions, particularly those related to caregiving. However, the effectiveness of organizational practices intended to mitigate such biases is less well understood. This study examines the use of COVID-19 impact statements in tenure decisions at research universities, an organizational intervention that was designed to reduce biases but raised concerns that it might inadvertently amplify them. Contrary to concerns about unintended consequences, a pre-registered survey experiment with 602 full professors in STEM fields reveals that the inclusion of impact statements leads to more favorable tenure evaluations, regardless of faculty gender and disruption type. Qualitative evidence suggests that perceptions of pandemic-related disruptions as legitimate, externally imposed, time-limited events in the past help circumvent previously documented biases. This study enhances our understanding of organizational practices that effectively mitigate biases and points to the potential role of narrative framing in workplace evaluations and organizational inequalities.\n\nClose\n\n\n\n\nAbstract Citation",

    "link": "https://sociologicalscience.com/articles-v11-21-579/",
    "description": "Does (under-)performance of athletes from stigmatized racial groups influence the incidence of racial hate crimes? We consider the case of the English national football team during the 2020 European Football Championship and analyze whether the performance of black players during the final at Wembley affected the number of racial hate crimes committed in London. The three English players who missed their penalties in the final are all black English players. Combining insights from (displaced) frustration-aggression and scapegoat theory, we argue that the frustration of losing the final resulted in violence directed at racial minority group members in London. Our findings show that the lost final triggered a 30 percent increase in racial hate crimes in the weeks following the event. The immediate impact was larger in boroughs with higher pre-event levels of racial hate crimes, indicating a galvanizing instead of a mobilizing exacerbation of this trigger event.",

    "link": "https://sociologicalscience.com/articles-v11-20-553/",
    "description": "The changes in daily life induced by the COVID-19 pandemic brought renewed attention to longstanding concerns about social isolation in the United States. Despite the links between the physical setting for individuals&#8217; daily lives and their connections with family, friends, and the various institutions of collective life, trends in where American adults spend their time have been largely overlooked as researchers have focused on how and with whom they spend their time. This article analyzes data from the American Time Use Survey over a timeframe spanning nineteen years and argues that the changes in Americans&#8217; daily routines induced by the COVID era should be seen as an acceleration of a longer-term trend: the rise of time spent at home. Results show that from 2003 to 2022, average time spent at home among American adults has risen by one hour and 39 minutes in a typical day. Time at home has risen for every subset of the population and for virtually all activities. Preliminary analysis indicates that time at home is associated with lower levels of happiness and less meaning, suggesting the need for enhanced empirical attention to this major shift in the setting of American life.",

    "description": "Delia Baldassarri, Johanna Gereke, Max Schaub\nSociological Science September 6, 2024\n10.15195/v11.a30\n\n\n\nAbstract\n\nHow does prosocial behavior extend beyond in-group boundaries in multiethnic societies? The differentiation of Western societies presents an opportunity to understand the tension between societal pressures that push people outside the comfort zones of their familiar networks to constructively interact with unknown diverse others and the tendency toward homophily and in-group favoritism. We introduce a three-step model of out-group exposure that includes macrostructural conditions for intergroup encounters and microlevel dynamics of intergroup selection and interaction. Using lab-in-the-field experiments with a large representative sample of Italian natives and immigrants from the multiethnic city of Milan, we find that, when pushed to interact with non-coethnics, Italians generally treat them similarly to how they treat coethnics and value signs of social and market integration. However, when given the opportunity to select their interaction partners, Italians favor coethnics over immigrants. Taken together, these results help reconcile classical findings concerning the positive effects of intergroup contact with evidence documenting the persistence of out-group discrimination in selection processes. \n\nClose\n\n\n\n\nAbstract Citation",

    "link": "https://share.osf.io/preprint/E0202-C65-E53",
    "description": "Social media are frequently blamed for exacerbating ideological divides. We evaluate whether it is possible to design a social media platform that instead promotes productive, open-minded dialogue among users. We recruited 1,043 Americans who expressed willingness to test a new social media platform by installing a mobile app we developed for iOS and Android devices. Participants were randomly assigned to spend ten minutes on one of two versions of a simulated social media platform. The first was a control condition designed to resemble typical text-based social media sites, and users were told that people whose posts are liked very often receive a \u201cpopular user\u201d badge. The second version was identical to the first, but respondents were instead told users receive an \u201copen-minded\u201d badge if they respectfully engage with opposing viewpoints. Participants using both versions were asked to join an ongoing discussion about either gun control or immigration. Unbeknownst to them, each participant only interacted with chatbots powered by generative AI. We find that respondents assigned to the experimental condition exhibited more intellectually humble language in their posts and comments and reported experiencing more positive emotions. We do not find significant treatment effects on participants\u2019 self-reported intellectual humility, affective polarization, or issue attitudes. These results have important implications for future research on social media and social psychology and introduce new methods for conducting randomized controlled trials using generative artificial intelligence.",

    "description": "This chapter examines the different channels operated by and for people with disabilities and how the participation of disabled citizen journalists contributes to the social construction of disability. Citizen journalists create several disability news websites, blogs, podcasts, YouTube channels, and other media forms every year, reaching a large and expanding audience. Further, many of these outlets can and do have an impact beyond the disability community, influencing legacy media and non-disabled audiences. The chapter will discuss historical events (e.g., the independent living movement, the introduction of closed captioning), as well as trade organizations focused on disability rights (e.g., the National Center on Disability and Journalism).",

    "description": "This paper explores the opportunities and challenges that the promotion of European integration among Galician youth currently faces. We first examine the obstacles that the region faces, which revolve around a lack of awareness, representation and pro-European civil society organizations, a limited knowledge of the English language and geographical isolation. However, Galicia is a region that enjoys unique opportunities, which we then explore, such as a lack of Euroscepticism, strong cultural ties with other European regions, the Cami\u00f1o de Santiago, the region's key role in the maritime and artificial intelligence sectors, and low third-level education costs. We conclude by proposing a series of recommendations to better equip the region of Galicia with the tools and resources needed to promote Europeanism among young people. Through our recommendations, we aim to foster a sense of European identity and solidarity among young people in Galicia, which is essential for the further integration of Galicia into the European Union.",

    "link": "https://share.osf.io/preprint/E00AE-8FC-77E",
    "description": "This article argues that process models of criminal decision-making require not only data capturing the inputs (person and setting characteristics) and outputs of a decision process (intention/action), but also data pertaining to the decision process itself. It further proposes a rigorous methodological framework, referred to as the virtual reality process tracing approach (VRPTA), which allows researchers to test predictions not only about what decisions people make but also about how they make them. It brings together the process tracing methodology used in the cognitive, social and behavioural sciences and combines it with experimental VR scenarios used in criminology. The result is a versatile methodological framework that utilises real-time decision-making by study participants immersed in experimentally manipulated VR environments, along with process tracing techniques that allow researchers to open the black box of decision-making. To make the contribution as tangible as possible, this article discusses the novel methodological approach by reference to its application in the context of Situational Action Theory\u2019s (SAT) perception choice process (PCP). With some modification it may also be used for a range of other process-oriented theories in criminology and beyond.",

    "description": "There are many instances wherein people are discredited and stigmatized because of what they see as being factual, true, or scientific. This paper analyzes how knowledge and fact claims are tied to stigmatization. More specifically, this paper examines how stigmatizers use fact claims to dehumanize and exclude others. The data for this paper is drawn from an online ethnography of two online communities, one for involuntarily celibate (or \u201cincel\u201d) men (incels.is), and the other focused on far-right politics and White supremacy (4chan.org/pol/). Using Link and Phelan\u2019s (2014) Stigma Power framework, I demonstrate how members of these communities use knowledge and fact claims to keep people down (degrade and dehumanize others), keep people in (police in-group members and enforce norms), and keep people away (exclude others and mark them as dangerous). I argue that keeping people down, in, and away work \u2018hand in glove\u2019 to discredit and distance others based on fact claims. The paper aims to combine social psychological and science studies perspectives on stigma, while also demonstrating how the stigmatization of knowledge and fact claims can advance polarization and radicalization.",

    "link": "https://share.osf.io/preprint/E0022-B70-CCA",
    "description": "Understanding the parental leave system at childbearing age is crucial for life after childbirth, regardless of gender. According to a 2021 UNICEF report, Japan has the best paid paternity leave policy in the world. However, the uptake rate of parental leave for Japanese male employees remains low compared to international averages. Many Japanese fathers may be underutilizing this benefit of this highly ranked parental leave system. Although there are several reasons for this, this study focuses on a lack of understanding of the particulars parental leave system. The empirical results of this study show that female employees possess more knowledge than their male counterparts and that the determinants of this knowledge differ between men and women. A worrying aspect of these results is the lack of opportunities for young male employees to improve their parental leave knowledge in the \u201clowest-low fertility\u201d society of Japan. Future research is needed to try to identify new determinants of this knowledge to better understand and overcome the relationship of this problem to Japan\u2019s low fertility rate.",

    "link": "https://share.osf.io/preprint/E00A3-278-D76",
    "description": "Pollution has been a major threat to the sustainability of the commons. In the Tragedy of the Commons, Garrett Hardin explained that freedom to add to a commons can expose it to pollution (Hardin, 1968). Behaviours of individuals who add to the commons should thus be governed if it is to be protected from pollution. In the context of shared natural resources, we have plenty of evidence that this is true. Consequently, to protect them from pollution we now have some safeguards to govern what is added to the common pool and how it is added. Yet, while significant attention has been given to pollution in natural resources, how it emerges in the case of shared knowledge has received little attention. As a shared resource, knowledge is valuable when it grows and is enriched. The sustainability of the knowledge commons rests on the community adding to the common pool. Yet, as some commons scholars have argued, an addition to the common pool doesn\u2019t necessarily increase the value of the knowledge commons. Some could increase it, while others could decrease it (Coriat, 2011; Kranich, 2007; Lougee, 2007; Ostrom & Hess, 2007). In this article, I will focus on how behaviours of adding to the knowledge commons expose it to the threat of pollution. What is pollution in the knowledge commons and how does it occur? Why does it occur? How can a knowledge commons be protected from it? And what are the challenges that emerge in doing so?",

However, in the early decades of the 21st century, a growing number of scholars began to challenge the traditional peer review procedure, questioning its efficacy. This study aims to provide a fresh perspective on the peer review mechanism, with the objective of enhancing the implementation of scientific communication's functionalities. The research employs historical analysis techniques and modelling methods based on Business Process Model and Notation (BPMN) to compare diverse review models in terms of their influence on scientific communication. BPMN is a conventional tool employed for modelling and describing business processes. The evolution of the peer review procedure is explored, encompassing an examination of the factors contributing to current and future transformations in the publishing realm. The author refers to the crisis of the conventional peer review system and the growing prevalence of preprints, serving as exemplars of these transformations.

    "description": "Social science research gives rise to what we call the \u2018refugee mobility puzzle\u2019: While restrictions on the freedom of residence limit refugees\u2019 socio-economic integration, those who do not face such restrictions often move to areas with high unemployment that similarly hinder their labor market prospects. This study addresses a central element of this puzzle: What draws refugees to high unemployment areas? We propose the spatial overlap hypothesis arguing that refugees in comparatively generous reception systems initially prioritize or are forced to prioritize non-labor-market resources such as affordable housing and proximity to social networks. Thereby they often settle in areas with general economic disadvantage as such areas frequently overlap with said resources. Based on the IAB-BAMF-SOEP Survey of Refugees this study tracks residential histories of more than 2,400 refugee respondents across all German counties and postcodes. Discrete choice models show that preferences for cities, lack of affordable housing, the presence of small, service-oriented companies, and co-ethnic communities explain refugees\u2019 gravitation to disadvantaged areas. These results support the spatial overlap hypothesis and suggest that recently approved refugees face trade-offs: area characteristics that are initially attractive tend to spatially overlap with such that likely inhibit longer-term integration prospects.",

    "link": "https://share.osf.io/preprint/E01FC-3DC-338",
    "description": "Benefit cutbacks have been prominent after the Great Recession. The Family Economic Stress Model (FESM) theorises how financial losses such as those spurred by cutbacks might adversely affect parental and child well-being. Yet few links with policy have been established. We extend current knowledge by comprehensively assessing how benefits cutbacks may affect parents and their adolescent children. We rely on the first ten waves of the UK Household Longitudinal Study (2009-2019) and an event-study approach to examine the aftermath of an exceptional raft of benefit cutbacks. We find that mothers with lower incomes and single mothers accumulated losses equal to 20-30% of their household benefit income. Mothers could not fully compensate for such benefit income losses via their extra earnings, despite increased workforce participation. Financial worries, some forms of material hardship, and mental health worsened among mothers with lower incomes and single mothers exposed to cutbacks. Adolescent socio-emotional difficulties also increased in the period. We find little evidence, though, that cutbacks disrupted parenting. Parents thus display more agency than that accorded by the FESM. Nonetheless, findings point to deepening socioeconomic divides in financial and mental well-being, questioning the rationale for cutbacks.",

    "description": "In March 2024, the U.S. Office of Management and Budget (OMB) approved major changes to the ethnic and racial self-identification questions used by all federal agencies, including the U.S. Census Bureau. These modifications include merging the separate race and Hispanic ethnicity questions into a single combined question and adding a Middle Eastern and North African category. Government officials and researchers have requested evidence on how Americans might react to these changes. We conducted a survey experiment with a nationally representative sample of 7,350 adult Americans. Participants were randomly assigned to answer either the existing separate race and ethnicity questions or a combined question proposed by the OMB. We find that the combined question decreases the percentage of Americans identifying as White and as Some Other Race. We identify the key mechanism driving these effects: Hispanics decrease their identification in other categories when a Hispanic category is available in the combined question format. This results in statistically significant decreases in key minority populations, including Afro-Latinos and Indigenous Latinos.",

    "description": "Adriano S. Senkevics, Rog\u00e9rio J. Barbosa, Flavio Carvalhaes, Carlos A. Costa Ribeiro\nSociological Science September 10, 2024\n10.15195/v11.a31\n\n\n\nAbstract\n\nAccess to higher education depends on the interaction between social origins and academic performance: background resources boost academic skills; but even when controlling for performance, privileged students are more likely to make  ambitious choices and further transitions. Recent literature has shown that inequality in educational choices is heterogeneous across countries. However, it is still not well understood how different institutional designs within countries may affect the workings of those effects and how they can strengthen or weaken the inequality of educational opportunities. Using high-quality register data from the Brazilian higher education system, our work contributes to this understanding by investigating how SES and performance interact and drive students&#8217; choice between three different tracks: not entering higher education, entering the private system, or entering the public system. We developed a strategy to encompass multinomial choices and decompose the inequalities into primary and secondary effects. Using the Shapley Value decomposition strategy, we correct an intrinsic asymmetry that biased previous results. Our findings suggest affluent students enjoy dual advantages: high exam performance amplifies access to public universities (indirect effect) and family resources offset subpar performance, ensuring private university access (direct effect). We found no signs of multiplicative advantages.\n\nClose\n\n\n\n\nAbstract Citation",

Research highlights substantial challenges in reintegrating this underserved and marginalized group across health and social domains. Urgent work is needed to understand their needs and develop effective social, criminological, and public health solutions. This study aimed to create a transdisciplinary, strengths-based framework to understand and begin addressing the reintegration needs of older individuals (50+) leaving prison. Applying Charmaz\u2019s Grounded Theory to qualitative data from Australia - including interviews and workshops with stakeholders and individuals with lived experience \u2013 resulted in the development of a 'Support-Efficacy' framework. Individuals leaving prison have varying levels of support needs and efficacy, shaped by their institutional experiences. Successful reintegration hinges on addressing these needs through stages of \"institutionalization,\" \"crisis,\" \"survival,\" and \"adjustment\". The findings offer robust theoretical insights and practical implications across disciplines including social work, criminology, and public health.",

    "description": "How do private companies justify taking on criminal justice functions? Building on writing on legitimacy and privatization, this article describes three rhetorical practices intended to increase the legitimacy of private companies carrying out criminal justice functions: softening (obscuring the use of force); shrinking (demonstrating deference to the state); and signaling (proclaiming alignment with pro-social values). The article demonstrates the analytic utility of these categories by considering public-facing Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) reports produced by one prominent company in the private corrections industry (CoreCivic). The conceptual typology of legitimation work brings together several dynamics that are common in privatized criminal justice and provides an analytic toolkit for future study. A discussion considers how researchers can use this typology to examine legitimation work by other private firms and industries that engage the criminal justice system.",

    "link": "https://share.osf.io/preprint/E010D-ED5-2CF",
    "description": "There is a longstanding interest in the link between economic conditions and fertility levels. Most research measuring economic development has focused on national-level patterns and period total fertility levels. This study aims to extend existing knowledge by carrying out a sub-national regional analysis of the link between economic conditions and parity-specific fertility, paying particular attention on the role of education. For this we look at three cohort fertility outcomes by women\u2019s level of education: the share of women who remain childless, the mean number of children per mother, and the mean number of children per woman. As data source we use harmonized register, census, and large-scale survey data from 15 European countries. We focus on women born in the late 1960s and measure their fertility at the end of their reproductive career. This information we combine with the regional GDP per capita of their region of residence at that time. Our findings show that, conditional on having become a mother, cohort fertility associates with economic development positively at the country level among high-educated women, but not among low-educated women. At the regional level within countries, the negative association between economic development and fertility among mothers is weaker among women with higher levels of education. In contrast, childlessness tends to be higher in countries and in sub-national regions characterized by higher GDP per capita levels. These findings suggest that continued childbearing by highly educated women plays an important role in offsetting high levels of childlessness in countries and regions with favourable economic conditions in Europe.",

    "description": "This study explores the use of generative AI (GenAI) and research integrity assessments of use cases by researchers, including PhD students, at Danish universities. Conducted through a survey sent to all Danish researchers from January to February 2024, the study received 2,534 responses and evaluated 32 GenAI use cases across five research phases: idea generation, research design, data collection, data analysis, and writing/reporting. Respondents reported on their own and colleagues' GenAI usage. They also assessed whether the practices in the use cases were considered good research practice. Through an explorative factor analysis, we identified three clusters of perception: \"GenAI as a work horse,\" \"GenAI as a language assistant only\", and \"GenAI as a research accelerator\". The findings further show varied opinions on GenAI's research integrity implications. Language editing and data analysis were generally viewed positively, whereas experiment design and peer review tasks faced more criticism. Controversial areas included image creation/modification and synthetic data, with comments highlighting the need for critical and reflexive use of GenAI. Usage differed by main research area, with technical and quantitative sciences reporting slightly higher usage and more positive assessments. Junior researchers used GenAI more than senior colleagues, while no significant gender differences were observed.",

    "description": "Pilgrimage has received longstanding scholarly attention, but most theoretical work focuses on how these rituals can be maintained, rather than the bigger puzzle of how they emerge. Using empirical inspiration from a new pilgrimage in Peru, we address this gap by outlining a theoretical framework more capable of accounting for how these phenomena get off the ground. We contend that the framework of an assurance game (a type of coordination game) captures the challenge of a collective ritual like pilgrimage emerging. By combining this assurance game with a model of Bayesian learning under uncertainty we illustrate how pilgrimage can be institutionalized on occasion. We further argue that our approach sheds light on the relationship between rituals and uncertainty, without having to make strong assumptions about individuals' psychological needs.",

(First uploaded as a preprint November 2023.) The AI development community is increasingly making use of hosting intermediaries such as Hugging Face that provide easy access to user-uploaded models and training data. These model marketplaces lower technical deployment barriers for hundreds of thousands of users, yet can be used in numerous potentially harmful and illegal ways. In this article, we argue that AI models, which can both `contain' content and be open-ended tools, present one of the trickiest platform governance challenges seen to date. We provide case studies of several incidents across three illustrative platforms --- Hugging Face, GitHub and Civitai --- to examine how model marketplaces moderate models. Building on this analysis, we outline important (and yet nevertheless limited) practices that industry has been developing to respond to moderation demands: licensing, access and use restrictions, automated content moderation, and open policy development. While the policy challenge at hand is a considerable one, we conclude with some ideas as to how platforms could better mobilize resources to act as a careful, fair, and proportionate regulatory access point.",

Today, these animistic stories constitute a major pillar Japan\u2019s school curriculum. The major themes of these stories are rejection of human superiority and encouragement of human-nature interdependence. In highlighting the Japanese case and exploring these stories for the first time in the English language, this piece intends to (i) inspire those seeking to integrate similar methods into formal education curricula in other contexts, and (ii) promote, on a worldwide scale, greater sensitivity to how the underlying meanings and messages found in language curriculum and textbooks connect (or fail to connect) to environmental concerns.

    "description": "This paper provides novel empirical evidence that the dynamic medium-term relationship between trade liberalization and growth varies significantly with economic structure. Using a local projections difference-in-differences (LP-DiD) approach with data from 161 countries between 1960 and 2019, I show that tariff reductions are associated with higher income per capita in manufacturer countries but, notably, lower income in nonmanufacturer ones. This result is confirmed through a comprehensive set of robustness checks, including a clean controls analysis, the use of a recent dynamic panel estimator, and extensive tests for potential endogeneity threats. Testing for mechanisms, I show that the baseline heterogeneity is also consistent with heterogeneous changes in productivity, capital accumulation, and the manufacturing share of GDP. These findings suggest that the recent rise in protectionism in manufacturer countries might be harmful, while existing calls for further liberalization in nonmanufacturers could have unintended consequences.",

    "description": "The rise of far-right movements during the COVID-19 pandemic has prompted a new form of individual digital activism: online monitoring activism (OMA). During the pandemic, online monitoring activists systematically collected, processed and published information from far-right Telegram channels and groups. Against the theoretical background of concepts like the monitory democracy and surveillance culture, we conducted eight semi-structured interviews with German online monitoring activists, investigating their motivations, roles, and the intricacies of their monitoring practices. Our findings reveal that online monitoring activists are driven by a sense of duty to counteract anti-democratic tendencies, which they perceive as inadequately addressed by institutional power. They gain localized and thematically specialized expertise that they share within loose networks of like-minded others. We highlight the activists\u2019 liminal identity oscillating between virtuous citizenship and vigilantism, as well as the broader societal implications of their actions. On the one hand, they fulfill the role of active citizenship in the monitory democracy; on the other, they also reinforce the transparency imperative and the wish for far-reaching security and control inherent to surveillance culture. The transparency potential afforded by their adversaries\u2019 online connective action and mobilizing efforts legitimizes their surveillance and demands surveillance. Further normative work is needed to critically examine the extent and desirability of increased social control introduced to liberal democracy by online monitoring activism.",

    "description": "At a time when ecological monitoring is crucial to implement efficient biodiversity conservation policies, we studied the perception of Marine Protected Areas (MPAs) agents on the place of ecological data in the functioning of MPAs. We interviewed agents working in eight of the main MPAs of the French Mediterranean Sea through qualitative surveys. We found that ecological monitoring encompasses multiple dimensions and fulfills several scientific, economic, psychological and political functions in the MPA while ultimately having limited effect on the implementation of biodiversity policies. The governance mode of some MPA and the chronic under-funding of marine conservation policies threatens both the quality of the ecological knowledge and its ability to affect decision-making. However, having ecological knowledge allows MPAs and their agents to establish themselves locally as essential institutions for marine biodiversity management. In this context, ecological monitoring not only justifies the existence of MPAs but can as a smokescreen, masking the absence of more stringent environmental regulations. Investigating how ecological monitoring is perceived within MPAs helps to unravel and describe the social and political processes underpinning ecological data and highlights its significance in contemporary marine conservation efforts.",

    "description": "Does the partisanship of governing coalitions matter in determining patterns of economic cooperation between countries? A vast political economy literature suggests that differences in the partisanship of a government explains a broad array of domestic public policies. However, the topic is insufficiently addressed by international relations scholars and mixed results abound. In this paper, we propose to evaluate the relationship between government partisanship, based on ideological measures for heads of governments, and economic cooperation between countries, observing their behavior concerning Bilateral Investment Treaties (BITs). When analyzing BITs signed between 1990 and 2015 between 164 countries, we found evidence that a government's partisanship does not explain the probability of signing such agreements. Nevertheless, when observing the phenomena in a dyadic framework and conditioning on the partner's partisanship, the results demonstrate that governments who share similar ideological views cooperate more, or at least are more likely to sign BITs with each other. Additionally, the ideological alignment hypothesis seems to be stronger between the governments of developing countries and countries with left-wing governments. This study therefore makes an important empirical contribution to the literature by stressing the role played by ideology in international cooperation and unveiling competing explanations for BIT formation.",

In this work, I intend to solve the empirical and theoretical puzzle involving political representation and trade policy by offering and testing an alternative explanation. My answer lies in the Stigler-Peltzman (S-P) analysis of regulation, formalized by Chang et al. in \\emph{Electoral Systems and the Balance of Consumer-Producer Power}. I adapt their theory and evaluate the effect of electoral institutions on the level of trade protection. More specifically, I analyze 53 democracies from 1996 to 2008 and estimate the effect of electoral systems' level of responsiveness, measured as electoral disproportionality, on trade protection. The findings indicate that the higher the rate of proportionality created by electoral institutions, the greater the level of protection that politicians will provide for special interest groups, especially in non-presidential democracies.",

This study investigates the extent to which hypothetical party statements supporting or opposing a ban on exploration of new oil and gas fields influences opinions about this policy, and the salience of climate change. Results from a pre-registered online survey experiment of 1650 participants in Australia and New Zealand show that political statements impact policy support and opinions of policy efficacy, but have little discernible effect on participants\u2019 perceptions of climate change salience. These results suggest that the public issue salience of climate change is stable, potentially making it challenging for politicians to pursue transformational climate policies.",

Yet, despite an abundance of illuminating work in science and technology studies (STS), we lack a rigorous sociological framework for explaining how scientific facts emerge, gain traction, and then change over time.

Drawing on Fleck ([1935] 1981), Haydu (1998), and a wealth of STS scholarship, I develop a comparative-historical approach called \u201creiterated fact-making\u201d that analyzes scientific facts according to (1) the prevailing conditions of possibility; (2) the networks of expertise, social mobilization, and power built up around them; and (3) the epistemic and material path dependencies that accrue over the course of their careers. To demonstrate the utility of this framework, I draw on a mixed-methods study and explain the uneven histories of three genetic variants (XYY, Fragile X, and the 22q11.2 microdeletion) that have been used to delineate and diagnose new medical conditions associated with neurodevelopmental differences for the past several decades\u2014taking on very different scientific, clinical, and social meanings as facts in the process.

    "link": "https://share.osf.io/preprint/E0236-C12-B45",
    "description": "BACKGROUND: People with disabilities are underemployed. This improved recently, but how broadly across disability type? US law allows employers to pay people with disabilities far below minimum wage, typically in segregated settings (sheltered workshops), if employers hold federal 14(c) certificates. Almost everyone in 14(c) employment has an intellectual/developmental disability. Some states have eliminated sheltered workshops, and the Biden administration may propose phasing them out. This is controversial. OBJECTIVE: To examine employment patterns pre- and post-pandemic among people with disabilities and patterns in use of sheltered workshops. METHOD: We analyzed American Community Survey data on employment rate, by type of disability (or lack of disability), for 2010-2023, Department of Labor data on 14(c) subminimum wage certificates in Community Rehabilitation Programs for 2010-2024, and Department of Labor data on number of workers paid subminimum wages in such programs for 2015-2024. RESULTS: American Community Survey data show the disability employment gap narrowing post-pandemic for every disability category\u2014but narrowing especially dramatically for people with cognitive disabilities. Long-term, the employment gap for people with cognitive disabilities narrowed in every state while Department of Labor data show 14(c) enrollment decreasing in every state. CONCLUSION: Research to inform public policy and hiring and retention practices should take advantage of the post-pandemic improvement in the employment gap for people with disabilities, especially cognitive disabilities, and marketing investments should promote them.",

It aims therefore to contribute a more nuanced understanding of experts and expertise, drawing attention to experts\u2019 role in both protection and prestige. It reveals how World Heritage emerged as a Faustian pact between protection and prestige, and a productive tension between these elements remains at its core, embodied by the heritage expert.

    "description": "How do artificial intelligence (AI) tools affect people's knowledge? Existing scholarship supports contrasting expectations. Some research shows that people often find AI-generated (\"synthetic\") texts clearer, more accessible, and more enjoyable to read, which can foster learning from the texts. However, other research shows that synthetic texts are derivative and homogeneous, making them less interesting and thus potentially inimical to learning. In two experimental studies, we find that people who read AI-generated summaries of historical events more accurately recall factual information about the events compared to people who read human-written summaries of the same event. In the first study (N=193), participants who read synthetic text describing the Seattle General Strike of 1919 correctly answered more fact-based questions than participants who read a text written by experts. The preregistered second study, with a sample nationally representative of the United States (N=1907) and additionally testing a second historical event, replicates the results of the first study. Study 2 also indicates that synthetic historical summaries have a positive effect regardless of whether subjects know they were generated by AI, as well as whether or not the summaries exhibit political biases. Furthermore, while synthetic summaries improve knowledge for participants across all levels of educational attainment, the largest improvements occur at the lowest levels. Our findings show how AI-generated texts can enhance learning and reduce, rather than amplify, educational inequalities.",

    "description": "Both freedom of movement and voting in European elections are fundamental citizenship rights at the heart of European integration. Ideally, EU citizens should be able to exercise both rights simultaneously. Yet, in practice, there is a tension between the two: Despite their strong emotional attachment to the Euro-pean Union, EU citizens residing outside their country of citizenship have a re-duced likelihood to vote in European elections. This article demonstrates this pattern empirically for German emigrants in the 2019 European Parliament elec-tion, based on data from the German Emigration and Remigration Panel Study (GERPS). This survey is unique because it covers both mobile German citizens who currently live abroad and those who have lived abroad but have recently re-turned to Germany. Self-reported turnout was significantly reduced among those currently living abroad. Bureaucratic hurdles (including early opt-in registration deadlines, complex, non-standardized registration procedures, and tedious access to ballot) are identified as a key explanation for this reduced turnout. These find-ings seem to conflict with basic democratic principles and could have political implications: Since there are more than eleven million mobile EU citizens who are eligible to vote, the reduced probability to vote among mobile Europeans could affect election outcomes.",

Threats are being experienced by individuals on the mental, physical and community health levels. Although psychologists have long had the skills-set necessary to conceptualise and support interventions for the challenges we face, it is only in recent years that psychological professional bodies are acknowledging the CEE. Therefore, there is no clear vision for the role of clinical psychology in the CEE. This study sought to create a vision of how clinical psychology can engage with the CEE as a means to mitigate and adapt to its deleterious impacts on mental health. Story completion methodology was used to create such visions. Forty-nine practitioner psychologists and climate activists completed online individual stories, and 28 individuals participated in co-creating stories, a novel application of story completion methodology. Thematic analysis was used to analyse the individual written stories and transcribed group stories. The possible roles for clinical psychology were developed across three main themes. 1. Acknowledgment is the First Step; here clinical psychology could acknowledge the root causes of the CEE and emotional responses to them. 2. Engagement in the CEE is Part of Creating a Role; here clinical psychology could develop a nature-based understanding of mental health, as well as supporting others to overcome cognitive defences and engage in the CEE. 3. Going Forth in Unison; here clinical psychology could work alongside changing societies to support people in living more simply, to develop community and nature-based practice, to support their own and others\u2019 climate activism, to become political and work towards social justice, to work in collaboration and to support people in developing their imaginative capabilities.

Based on the literature on visual analysis as well as social media research, we investigate what politicians post and how they use the different features of social media platforms and Instagram in particular. First, we demonstrate that German national MPs are strongly present on Instagram across parties, gender and age groups which is why we, in a second step, closely examine the Instagram activities (N=1279) of 24 German national MPs, using a pre-defined codebook. We show that MPs predominately display behind-the-scenes images as well as state their opinion on political issues. The visibility of issues strongly depends on parties\u2019 issue ownership and on contextual factors. Furthermore, we highlight that younger MPs have a more sophisticated use of Instagram and integrate the social media platform more strongly into their daily political activities.",

    "link": "https://share.osf.io/preprint/E01AB-BF0-A43",
    "description": "Background: In 2023, Wave 2 of an annual, nationally representative longitudinal survey found a concerning level of agreement that civil war was likely in the United States and, among those who agreed, widespread belief that civil war was needed. This study updates those findings to this election year and explores respondents\u2019 predicted involvement in such a conflict. Methods: Findings are from Wave 3, conducted May 23-June 14, 2024; participants were members of Ipsos KnowledgePanel. All respondents to prior waves who remained in KnowledgePanel were invited to participate; to facilitate comparison with the 2023 findings, this analysis is restricted to Wave 3 respondents who had responded to both Wave 1 and Wave 2. Outcomes are expressed as weighted proportions and adjusted prevalence differences, with p-values adjusted for the false discovery rate and reported as q-values. Results: The Wave 3 completion rate was 88.4% overall and 91.6% for respondents to Wave 2; there were 8185 respondents in the analytic sample. After weighting, half the sample was female (50.6%, 95% confidence interval (CI) 49.1%, 52.1%); the weighted mean (\u00b1 standard deviation) age was 50.8 (16.4) years. Few respondents agreed strongly or very strongly that \u201cin the next few years, there will be civil war in the United States\u201d (6.5%, 95% CI 5.7%, 7.3%) or that \u201cthe United States needs a civil war to set things right\u201d (3.6%, 95% CI 3.0%, 4.2%). These prevalences were higher among subsets of respondents having characteristics previously associated with increased support for and willingness to commit political violence. A large majority (84.2%, 95% CI 83.1%, 85.3%) considered it not likely that they would participate as a combatant if civil war did occur. Of the 3.7% (95% CI, 3.1%, 4.3%) who thought it very or extremely likely that they would be combatants, 44.5% (95% CI, 36.5%, 52.6%) reported that their position would convert to not likely if this were urged by family members, 23.4% (95% CI, 16.7%, 30.1%) if by friends, 30.5% (95% CI, 23.0%, 38.0%) if by a respected religious leader, 26.3% (95% CI, 19.4%, 33.3%) if by a respected elected official or other public figure, and 23.6% (95% CI, 16.4%, 30.8%) if by a respected news or social media source. Findings were similar for respondents who additionally reported that it was very or extremely likely that they would \u201ckill a combatant from the opposing side.\u201d Conclusions: In mid-2024, the expectation that civil war was likely and the belief that it was needed were uncommon and were unchanged from 2023. Those expecting to participate as combatants reported openness to change in response to input from many sources. These findings can help guide prevention efforts.",

    "link": "https://share.osf.io/preprint/E00D5-A85-4B2",
    "description": "The arrangement of social groups into partisan coalitions fundamentally shapes the content of political competition. How should we understand the interests and ideology holding together such coalitions? I introduce a framework, based on a spatial voting model, to study how issue attitudes generate electoral coalitions. The model decomposes group-level voting behavior into three components: the distribution of policy preferences, issue weights, and candidate positions. The model clarifies what data are necessary to sustain policy-based explanations for electoral realignments, and provides a lens through which to interpret correlations between vote choice and issue preferences. I apply this framework to explain educational realignment among white Americans \u2014 a trend that is disrupting longstanding class coalitions. Using nearly 200 survey questions to estimate issue-specific ideal points from 1984 to 2020, I find that both economic and cultural issues have driven educational realignment. Over the past 15 years, college-educated whites have become more favorable toward redistribution, pushing them toward the Democratic Party. Meanwhile, cultural issues have gained salience for the white working class, meaning their longstanding conservative cultural attitudes now translate into Republican support. Educational realignment is thus deeply rooted across issue domains, suggesting the stability of these new coalitions into the foreseeable future.",

The complexity of biodiversity markets elevates the power of the \u201cinnovators\u201d, whose expert knowledge and elite networks reshape the material world.

Previous research finds higher-status actors express less trust than lower-status actors in interpersonal and institutional contexts. Scholars explain this finding as an outcome of structural dependence\u2014when people have few alternative means for accessing valuable resources. In contrast, I find dependence inadequate to explain the relationship I observe between class and institutional trust among black families whose children were recommended for special education and other remedial program placement in an affluent, predominantly white school district. Drawing on retrospective interviews from a community ethnography, findings show that real-world trust decision processes also involve domination. Empirical studies of trust have overlooked the ways trustees\u2014those being given trust\u2014exercise power to achieve deference in trust exchanges, and how trustors\u2014those placing trust in others\u2014deploy their power to withstand trustees\u2019 influence. I argue that trust might best be conceptualized as a two-part decision process, because class and other status resources affect trustors\u2019 freedom to choose at two key junctures: (1) in weighing options and costs of trust errors, and (2) in communicating distrust in face-to-face interactions, where the potential for domination is high.

    "description": "Background: Since the WHO declared Covid-19 a pandemic, prominent social actors and institutions have warned about the threat of misinformation, i.e., false or misleading information, calling on the public to join in a global crusade against it. However, neither the premises underlying expert claims nor the standards that experts use to identify truth from falsehood have been appraised. Objectives: We conducted a critical scoping review of the medical and social scientific literature, examining what this literature means by misinformation. Methods: We followed the framework of Arksey and O\u2019Malley for scoping reviews informed by the critical perspective of the \u201cwhat is the problem represented to be\u201d approach to policy analysis. Medical sources were identified from PubMed and from three medical journals - the British Medical Journal, The Lancet, and the New England Journal of Medicine \u2013 and social science sources were identified from the journal Social Science & Medicine and from within refereed publications of self-identified and socially recognized \u201cmisinformation experts\u201d, using a specified combination of search terms (e.g., \u201ccovid-19\u201d; \u201cmisinformation\u201d). Data were charted independently by two researchers. The protocol was registered in Open Science Frame. Findings: Across the data, we found that verifiability relied largely on the claims of socially recognized epistemic authorities to the exclusion of independent evidentiary standards. Further, \u201cepistemic authority\u201d did not depend on subject matter expertise, but rather on a new type of \u201cexpertise\u201d - in misinformation itself. Finally, policy solutions to the alleged threat that misinformation poses to democracy and human rights called for, paradoxically, suppressing information unverified, and debate unmanaged, by experts, in the name of protecting democracy and rights. Notably, we identified no pockets of resistance to these dominant meanings and uses. Conclusions: We assess the implications of our findings for democratic public policy, and for fundamental rights and freedoms.

    "description": "Genetic and archaeological evidence imply a second major movement of Neanderthals from Western to Central and Eastern Eurasia sometime in the Late Pleistocene. The genetic data suggest a date of 120-80ka for the dispersal and the archaeological record provides an earliest date of arrival in the Altai by ca. 60ka. Because the number of archaeological sites linking the two regions is very small, the exact route taken and its timing have been the matter of considerable debate. In particular, climate change in this period modified landscapes considerably, changing the cost of moving in different directions. Using agent-based least-cost path simulations, we show here that the northern route through the Urals and southern Siberia was the most likely route taken under all climate scenarios. Agents reach the Altai during two time windows when the climate was mild, MIS 5e (the last Interglacial), and in MIS 3, the latter coinciding with the archaeological evidence from Chagyrskaya and Okladnikov Caves in the Altai.",

Thus, this paper produces the first systematic global analysis of the politicisation of industrial development organisations. I produce the following four stylised facts. First, industrial policymaking is predominantly political. Over 60% of the industrial policy organisations in my data are run by politicians. Second, lower-income countries use a higher proportion of political organisations to do their industrial policy. Third, there is great variation in the proportion of political organisations in each policy area. Politicians run 30% of Export-Import and Central banks. Politicians run 60% of organisations focused on primary commodities. Fourth, the proportion of organisations run by bureaucrats is positively and statistically significantly correlated with several measures of bureaucratic quality. This relationship is robust to controlling for the number of industrial policy organisations and GDP per capita.",

    "description": "The rapid advance of artificial intelligence (AI) raises profound governance questions for all societies. However, the discourse on AI governance thus far has been led by a small number of countries that are the leaders in AI technology. Little research has been done on how Global South countries can enhance their AI governance capacity. Are the countries of the Global South simply passengers in flight \u2013 passive adopters of AI technology, norms, and governance practices developed elsewhere? How much priority should Global South countries give to AI governance in light of the numerous other challenges they face? This article argues that the Global South passengers do have the ability to take meaningful steps to improve their AI governance capacity. The first step is to have a conceptual framework for AI governance. The framework recognizes AI as a general purpose technology whose impact will extend over a multi-decade period, and understands that the distributional outcomes of AI will be determined primarily by the choices societies make, not the technology itself. Hence the pressing challenge of governing AI is not primarily the search for today\u2019s most comprehensive regulation, but rather a long-term process of taking practical, proactive local steps to generate knowledge and gain experience over time. To apply the framework, the article recommends several specific areas of governance for consideration by government, academics, enterprises and civil society in the Global South.",

    "description": "Resource efficiency strategies are key to reduce material use and help limit global warming to below 2\u00b0C in 2100. Understanding the role of such strategies at municipal-level requires a localized approach. Here we evaluate a ramp-up of resource efficiency strategies and their associated effects on vehicle usage and climate benefits towards 2050 for 19 individual sub-regions within the Greater Oslo region in Norway. In our scenarios, material stocks increase from 344 megatonnes (Mt) in 2022 to 349-367 Mt in 2050 driven by population growth, with low-end estimate relying on a sufficiency scenario limiting floor area per capita and banning new single-family houses. The sufficiency (SUF) scenario reduces total material consumption until 2050 (48 Mt) with 28% relative to a business-as-usual (BAU) scenario (66.3 Mt) with continuation of ongoing trends, thereby reducing GHG emissions from material production by 17% (BAU: 12.44 MtCO2-eq, SUF: 10.36 MtCO2-eq). If resource efficiency strategies are combined with rapid material production decarbonization in-line with a 2\u00b0C scenario, a 30% reduction in emissions is achievable (8.67 MtCO2-eq). Car ownership rates and traveled distance per capita decrease in the sufficiency scenario compared to 2022 with 6.4%. Assuming the current relationship between settlement characteristics and transport demand, total driving distance fails to decline due to population growth. Limiting the floor-area per capita in residential buildings significantly decreases material demand. Resource efficiency strategies including densification need to be complemented with a rapid decarbonization of material supply and stronger incentives to move away from car driving to maximize climate change mitigation.",

In the present work we test this idea with a sample of universities for which data are available.

This has been conventional wisdom and many scholars and policy makers have argued that the absence of global war after World War II has been the result of nuclear deterrence. We challenge this consensus on theoretical and empirical grounds and argue that deterrence strategies that rely on nuclear weapons and MAD are inherently dangerous and rest on assumptions that fail to account for the complexity of real-world crises. Conversely, the value of United States conventional weapons has been underappreciated and serves in two vital roles -- deterring conflict and enabling flexible punishment strategies. We examine the quantitative literature on nuclear deterrence and find that existing research is inadequate if we want to understand the role of conventional and nuclear weapons in deterrence. We conclude with a series of case studies to illustrate important and underdiscussed facets of deterrence, and discuss the implications for the current Russian invasion of Ukraine.",

    "description": "This report explores the application of framing theory to sustainability communication, examining how different framing approaches can influence public perception and engagement with environmental issues. Drawing on seminal works in framing theory and recent research in sustainability communication, the report analyzes four key framing dimensions: gain vs. loss, individual vs. collective action, present vs. future, and local vs. global. For each dimension, the report discusses the characteristics, effectiveness, and potential limitations of different framing approaches, supported by relevant research findings. Key insights include the varying effectiveness of gain and loss frames for mitigation vs. adaptation strategies, the importance of balancing individual and collective responsibility, the impact of temporal framing on urgency and long-term planning, and the role of geographical scale in making issues personally relevant. The report emphasizes that effective sustainability communication often requires a nuanced approach that strategically combines different framing dimensions based on the specific environmental issue, target audience, cultural context, and communication goals. By understanding and applying these framing concepts, communicators can more effectively engage audiences and promote sustainable behaviors and policies. This nuanced approach to framing can play a crucial role in addressing complex environmental challenges and driving meaningful progress in sustainability efforts.",

DRS are recognized as a critical strategy to enhance recycling rates, reduce environmental waste, and support the transition toward a circular economy. While empirical evidence from countries like Germany, Norway, and Lithuania indicates that DRS can achieve recycling rates exceeding 90%, challenges such as high setup costs, stakeholder resistance, policy inconsistency, and adaptability to market changes complicate their implementation and sustainability. The analysis synthesizes data from diverse geographic contexts, highlighting the factors that contribute to the success or failure of DRS, including public engagement, policy stability, technological adaptation, and effective stakeholder collaboration. The findings suggest that while DRS can provide substantial environmental and economic benefits, their long-term success is contingent upon sustained public participation, consistent policies, adaptability to market shifts, and robust stakeholder engagement. This study offers critical insights for policymakers, environmental advocates, and industry stakeholders seeking to optimize DRS as a tool for sustainable waste management.",

Although homogeneity compounding generally characterizes the whole field of philosophy and methodology of economics, one small and temporary subfield, making contributions to heterodox economics, structural realism, and the discussion on pluralism in economics, constituted a pocket of gender diversity. Alongside a more general discussion of possible reasons behind the striking gender imbalance in the field, we also elaborate on possible reasons for the limited size and duration of this pocket of diversity.",

    "description": "Same-sex couples experience high levels of unmet parenthood desires and often depend on the availability of adoption and assisted reproduction techniques to become parents. In many countries, assisted reproduction techniques are not covered by public health or health insurance schemes for women in same-sex couples, even though they are covered for women in different-sex couples. In this article, the importance of such restrictions for levels of parenthood is quantified by studying a policy reform in Spain. Women in same-sex couples were excluded from accessing assisted reproduction procedures free of charge through the Spanish public health system in 2013. Access was re-established in some areas in subsequent years, and ultimately in all of Spain in 2021. Using data from the Spanish census and large household surveys, we show a decline in the share of women in same-sex couples living with newborn children following the reform of 2013. Co-residence with newborn children among women in same-sex couples dropped to very low levels in areas where public access was not re-established in the subsequent years, whereas its prevalence increased elsewhere. These results illustrate the importance of access to assisted reproduction to tackle unmet parenthood desires among women in same-sex couples.",

Do native-born children of immigrants\u2014who often acquire better language skills, more education, and improved country-specific skills\u2014experience reduced workplace segregation relative to natives and better access to the mainstream economy than the immigrant generation? Using rich linked employer\u2013employee administrative data from Norway, we show that, on average, 32% and 16% of immigrants\u2019 and children of immigrants' coworkers have immigrant backgrounds, compared to 7% among natives. For economic segregation, the percentile rank of coworkers\u2019 salary is, on average, 36, 49, and 52 for immigrants, children of immigrants, and natives, respectively. A formal decomposition shows that variation in the characteristics of employees, workplaces, and residential neighborhoods collectively explain 54\u201374% and 79\u201384% of ethnic and economic workplace segregation for immigrants and their children. Within both immigrant generations, minority workers' education and occupational attainment, detailed industry of employment, working for an immigrant manager, and the share of immigrant neighbors make the largest contribution to workplace segregation relative to natives. This suggests that both skill-based sorting and network-related processes are key drivers of immigrant\u2013native workplace segregation. However, children of immigrants\u2019 improved access to less immigrant-dense and higher-paying workplaces compared to the immigrant generation is almost entirely attributable to differences in skill-based sorting (i.e., education, occupation, and sorting across detailed industries). These findings reveal sharp declines in workplace segregation relative to natives across immigrant generations, as children of immigrants advance into workplaces in the mainstream economy.",

    "link": "https://share.osf.io/preprint/E002A-ABF-7D1",
    "description": "A popular statistical approach in sociological research, the fixed-effects regression model is known for its ability to produce unbiased coefficients by adjusting for unobserved time-invariant individual heterogeneity. This ability, however, is contingent on an often-overlooked assumption that time-invariant variables must not have time-varying effects, which, otherwise, would interfere in the process of coefficient estimation, leading to misinterpretations of the findings. Demonstrating with case studies, we intend to explain and clarify two types of such misinterpretations: (1) time-invariant variables\u2019 time-varying effects, when measured in the model, are mistaken as time-invariant variables\u2019 unbiased coefficient estimates; (2) time-invariant variables\u2019 time-varying effects, when unmeasured in the model, confound coefficient estimates for time-varying variables.",

    "link": "https://share.osf.io/preprint/E00CA-5DB-028",
    "description": "Introduction Plastic pollution poses significant environmental, economic, and health risks, with single-use tableware and packaging constituting a third of plastic waste. To mitigate this crisis, there is a pressing need to adopt reusable tableware. However, obstacles such as cost, the prevalence of takeaway culture, and the gap between intentions and purchasing behaviors hinder their widespread use. Whilst research identifies these barriers, there is a need for more studies across diverse populations. Notably, there is limited research on the use of reusable tableware by those within educational settings. Understanding the specific barriers and facilitators for this demographic is crucial for adopting enduring and positive practices that could significantly reduce future plastic pollution. Objective To describe and analyse the existing literature and examine the extent to which it describes the use of reusable tableware, including the barriers and facilitators to their use, by those within educational settings. Inclusion Criteria Research studies published between 2004 and 2023 on the use of reusable tableware within the education setting (including: primary and secondary schools, colleges, higher education institutions such as universities) on students and / or discussions with parents / carers and school staff on their perceived thoughts on their use. Reusable tableware will include plates, bowls, trays, cups, lids and straws, cutlery, and takeout containers. There is no requirement for limiting geographical area. Methods The scoping review will be conducted in accordance with the Joanna-Briggs Institute (JBI) methodology for scoping reviews. The databases to be searched include APA PsycInfo (ProQuest), SCOPUS, Web of Science Core Collection, and the Education Database. Studies will be screened against and selected in line with the inclusion criteria. A data extraction tool will be created to tabularise the key data and narrative accounts from included studies, adapted from the JBI extraction tool. Data will be exported, synthesized, and presented, with a behaviour change analysis also being conducted. Ideas and recommendations for future interventions will be made, to increase the use of reusable tableware within the education setting.",

    "description": "We describe the heterogeneity of the Chinese immigrant population in France and investigate how immigrants\u2019 diverse patterns of social integration predict perceptions of racism, using survey data and in-depth interviews collected during the COVID-19 outbreak, a period during which anti-Chinese and anti-Asian xenophobia and racism were activated. Our unique data, collected for the Chinese Immigrants in the Paris Region (ChIPRe) Study, enable a classification of Chinese immigrants at the intersection of their migration histories, socio-demographic profiles, broad social integration indicators, and attributes of their social ties that characterize distinct patterns of social interaction with co-ethnics and with the wider French society. Our classification highlights three distinct groups: an established ethnic enclave of Wenzhou Chinese, an immigrant underclass whose members arrived in France after the dismantling of China\u2019s centrally planned economy, and successive cohorts of international students, many of whom have gained professional employment in France or intend to stay in France after graduation from institutions of higher education. These distinct immigrant profiles predict different frequencies of subjective experiences of racism that are not attributable to the conventional predictors of racism perceptions alone and add nuance to the discrepancy between conventional social integration indicators and discrimination and racism found among the main immigrant groups and their children in many European countries.",

    "description": "The importance of social relationships for the well-being of older adults is well-documented; however, the social lives of older adults with history of incarceration (HOI) have not been well explored. We used a mixed methods explanatory sequential design to examine the social relationships of older adults with (HOI). Quantitative data come from the Health and Retirement Study (N=13,995), a longitudinal study of U.S. older adults. Respondents with and without HOI were compared on the presence/absence of social relationships and relationship quality with respect to friends/children/other family members. Semi-structured interviews with formerly incarcerated older adults and human service providers (n=14) were used to explain quantitative findings. Compared to their counterparts, those with HOI were less likely to have close relationships with at least one child (OR: 0.45; 95% CI: 0.35-0.58) or other family members (OR: 0.77; 95% CI: 0.61-0.96). Further, they reported more negative interactions and less positive interactions with children/other family members. There was no association between HOI and having close friends or positive interactions with friends. Those with HOI, however, were more likely to report high negative interactions with friends than their counterparts (OR: 95% CI: 1.18-1.59). Interview participants discussed factors that negatively impact social relationships, including transportation issues, difficulties with technology that facilitate relationships, friend/family member illness and death, limited financial resources, and incarceration-related regulations that limit social interaction. Formerly incarcerated older adults face challenges in maintaining social relationships. Future studies should focus on interventions to foster social connection in this population.",

    "description": "Amid renewed interest in geographical inequalities in life chances and an ongoing debate about occupational upgrading versus polarisation, we investigate how the occupational structure changed across NUTS-2 regions in France, Italy, Spain and the UK between 1992 and 2018. Against the expectation that national upgrading trends may mask a diversity of regional upgrading, downgrading and polarisation experiences, EU Labour Force Survey data show clear and unambiguous upgrading. In every region, employment in high quality jobs grew while employment in low quality jobs shrank. These shifts were often large in magnitude: the proportion of employment in high quality jobs increased by more than 10 percentage points in two thirds of the regions studied. However, there was considerable heterogeneity in the rate and type of occupational upgrading. Strong upgrading and employment growth in the economic capital regions of \u00cele-de-France (Paris), Lombardy, Madrid and London contrasted with weaker upgrading and sluggish (or even negative) employment growth in regions like Lorraine, Sicily, Extremadura and the West Midlands. That these and many regions have yet to achieve the same proportion of high quality jobs that the economic capitals possessed in 1992 highlights the greater relative difficulty of ascending to the top of the occupational structure in some places than others.",

This study examines the effects of horizontal education-job mismatch on organizational commitment, job satisfaction, and future career vision among employees from a medium-sized company in Japan using longitudinal personnel microdata and employee satisfaction survey data. The empirical results of this study show that horizontal education-job mismatch in a medium-sized Japanese company has a negative impact on employees\u2019 psychological adjustment, even after controlling for individual-specific effects.

When Mehra20 was seen as a politicized attack on Donald Trump and hydroxychloroquine, its retraction was broadly shared as proof that the article had been published for political reasons. However, when Rose21 was seen as evidence of vaccine harm by vaccine opponents, its retraction was either ignored or else framed as a conspiracy to censor the truth.

    "description": "Lower-income households make trade-offs to afford their housing costs but most of these are not accounted for in the housing affordability measurements used by policy makers, according to new AHURI research. As a result, housing can appear affordable even though it is of such poor quality it affects people\u2019s health, it is too expensive to heat or cool or it is located far from employment opportunities so that householders have very high commuting costs. The research reviewed government policies and practices and investigated Australian case studies to better understand the quality, energy, and locational and transportation dimensions of housing affordability. The findings point to the need for a universally applied definition of safe and healthy housing standards across Australia and the need for policy makers to measure households\u2019 required energy expenditure, rather than their actual energy expenditure. The research case studies also reveal the relationship between housing affordability and locational advantage or disadvantage, that is being close to, or far from, employment, education, health facilities and cultural amenities. The research stresses that integrating housing, planning, transport and employment policies is critical to mitigating the risks of housing affordability stress and displacement for lower income householders, while offering increased accessibility to key resources and services. There is a need for programs to encourage private landlords to provide well-located, good quality, affordable rental housing. Furthermore, for low-to-moderate-income householders living in locationally disadvantaged areas, expanding transport assistance schemes can help to reduce transport costs and improve residents\u2019 connection to job-rich areas.",

    "description": "The main idea consists in researching the existence of certain characteristics of nature similar to human reasonability and purposeful actions, originating and rigorously inferable from the postulates of quantum mechanics as well as from those of special and general relativity. The pathway of the \u201cfree-will theorems\u201d proved by Conway and Kochen in 2006 and 2009 is followed and pioneered further. Those natural reasonability and teleology are identified as a special subject called \u201cGod\u201d and studyable by \u201cquantum theology\u201d, a scientific counterpart of classical theology as far as the latter endeavors to justify rationally God (without quotation marks) postulated by religion, but meaning in the present study, first of all, Christianity. The suggested \u201cquantum theology\u201d is situated in the historical opposition and conflict of science and religion in Modernity and its reflection in Heidegger\u2019s conception of \u201contotheology\u201d. The conception of \u201contomathematics\u201d introduced in previous papers to unite and unify physics, mathematics, and philosophy is reinterpreted in the present context to be conservatively generalized in a way to include \u201cquantum theology\u201d. Two conceptions, \u201clocality\u201d and \u201cnonlocality\u201d, originating initially from physics and especially, from theory of entanglement and quantum information, are also generalized ontomathematically, and thus in relation to the newly introduced \u201cquantum theology\u201d. The \u201cquantum theology\u201d subject of \u201cGod\u201d is juxtaposed with God of religion and billions of believers all over the world. Husserl\u2019s conception of \u201cphilosophy as a rigorous science\u201d is considered to be generalized now to theology as quantum theology, particularly by the phenomenon (in the sense of his \u201cphenomenology\u201d) of \u201cGod\u201d, or by an \u201cepoch\u00e9\u201d to whether God exists or not. The research of the phenomenon of \u201cGod\u201d is extended to the conception of the \u201ctotality\u201d being inherent for philosophy, especially for classical German philosophy preceding Husserl\u2019s phenomenology. Those sequences for philosophy implied by the introduction of quantum theology are investigated further, on the pathway of ontomathematics, also in relation to what \u201cGod\u201d should mean for today\u2019s physics and mathematics. The option and research field of \u201cexperimental quantum theology\u201d is discussed as a direct corollary from quantum theology though being sacrilegious as for classical theology. The concluding section reflects in a more loose way on the relation of \u201cGod\u201d for quantum theology to God for religion and billions of believers all over the world.",

However, men predominated in Science and Technology fields, leading to stereotypes and underrepresentation in social justice, human rights, national growth, and international competitiveness. Women were less likely to participate in classical science before the 20th century, compared to social sciences, law, and the humanities. Women in science faced obstacles such as career tailoring, family resistance, gender imbalance, and gender-sensitive education. Research shows no significant biological differences between men and women in science and math aptitude. However, women are underrepresented in science faculties due to societal norms, stereotypes, exclusion, and a male-dominated culture. New approaches to addressing this issue include focusing on \u201dfixing the system\u201d and removing obstacles, cultural norms, and attrition points that drive women away from science. Feminist authors in science aim to demonstrate that women can pursue careers in science, identify barriers that prevent women from engaging in science, rectify inaccurate data regarding women\u2019s biology, and question the principles and goals of science. Feminist science should focus on analytical tools that enable feminist criticism and the generation of scientific research. Women scientists face various challenges in science, including a \u201dglass ceiling\u201d that owers the bar for success recognition, discriminatory practices, and isolation. Empowered women should act as mentors and draw other women into central networks. To achieve gender parity in science, awareness campaigns must be launched, and gender imbalances should be balanced to prevent underrepresentation in professions and positions of decision-making.",

I show that an event of elderly death is associated with 23% additional education completed over a period of 4 years by affected girls. I present evidence that changes in demand for informal caregiving among older female children within the household are one of the mechanisms at play. These results highlight the importance of female teenagers in caregiving activities and suggest that policies that increase the availability of formal care for the elderly could reduce gender inequalities in education in contexts similar to Senegal.",

Using data from 27,445 underground and mainstream rap singles released in the United States from 1971 to 2016, we test the hypothesis that the content of rap lyrics is correlated with quantitative measurements of crime, sexual assaults, economic conditions, and substance abuse.

    "description": "In 2021, the concept of NFTs gained worldwide attention when a digital artist known as \u2018Beeple\u2019 sold his work Everydays: The First 5000 Days for 69 million US dollars at Christie\u2019s, placing him among the top three living artists by sale value (Kastrenakes 2021). Since then, \u201cnon-fungible token\u201d (or \u201cNFT\u201d) has rapidly become a high-scoring term on Google Trends and there has been corresponding growth in the number of artists, collectors, and platforms dealing with NFTs. Because of the many NFT platforms, the enormous volume of NFTs, the involvement of various cryptocurrencies, the fluctuating prices, and unpredictability of trends, navigating the NFT art market is very complicated. In an attempt to engage in this new sphere of speculation (and to speculate about it), we opened a physical NFT Shop at an abandoned gas station. Besides NFT art, we offered conversation and warm coffee to visitors. Surprisingly, we found almost everyone we met had heard about NFTs, although few demonstrated any in-depth knowledge. Our NFT Shop was expressly concerned with displaying only \u2018clean\u2019 NFTs, thereby underlining the environmental impact of typical blockchain technology. Tezos, a cryptocurrency known as a clean and eco-friendly \u2018crypto\u2019, is gaining popularity in the NFT art market as an alternative to Ethereum, which has a high carbon footprint (McDonald 2021) and high minting cost. According to Memo Akten\u2019s A guide to eco-friendly CryptoArt, the cost of transactions in Ethereum fluctuates between $100-$1000 (Akten 2021), which is in stark contrast to Tezos, where exchange fees are currently below a dollar. The high energy consumption of blockchain has generated strong opposition, especially among artists. Thus, many alternative NFT platforms such as objkt and fx(hash) use Tezos and brand themselves as an eco-friendly and affordable marketplaces. Despite the availability of relatively clean cryptos, many digital artists prefer not to be associated with CryptoArt of any kind. At the same time, the general audience for art largely assumes that all digital art is NFT art. From the perspective of digital artists, it is difficult to say whether NFTs are a blessing or a curse. On the one hand, the art market has become receptive to digital formats, so many artists now have the opportunity to make a living from their art. On the other hand, there remains much that seems \u2018unclean\u2019 about NFT markets, although all transactions are entirely transparent. In this context, this paper and our art project NFT Shop aim to offer a framework for making sense of the NFT marketplaces and thus help to demystify the concepts of NFT and related platforms.",

    "description": "Audiovisual news is a critical cultural phenomenon that has been influencing audience worldviews for more than a hundred years. To understand historical trends in multimodal audiovisual news, we need to explore them longitudinally using large sets of data. Despite promising developments in film history, computational video analysis, and other relevant fields, current research streams have limitations related to the scope of data used, the systematism of analysis, and the modalities and elements to be studied in audiovisual material and its metadata. Simultaneously, each disciplinary approach contributes significant input to research reducing these limitations. We therefore advocate for combining the strengths of several disciplines. Here we propose a multidisciplinary framework for systematically studying large collections of historical audiovisual news to gain a coherent picture of their temporal dynamics, cultural diversity, and potential societal effects across several quantitative and qualitative dimensions of analysis. By using newsreels as an example of such complex historically formed data, we combine the context crucial to qualitative approaches with the systematicity and ability to cover large amounts of data from quantitative methods. The framework template for historical newsreels is exemplified by a case study of the \u201cDaily News\u201d newsreel series produced in the Soviet Union during 1944\u20131992. The proposed framework enables a more nuanced analysis of longitudinal collections of audiovisual news, expanding our understanding of the dynamics of global knowledge cultures.",

    "description": "In this research note, I contend that identifying and interpreting parenthood age effects is challenging. The challenge lies in separating the effects due to children being born to a later calendar year (child\u2019s birth year effects) from those due to being born to an older parent (parenthood age effects per se). I draw the analogy with the fundamental problem of age-period-cohort analysis and show how a bounding approach proposed by Fosse and Winship might be helpful to elicit and address this challenge. My analysis, focusing on children\u2019s educational attainment using data from Belgium, Germany, the Netherlands, and Sweden, reveals that child\u2019s birth year effects can indeed be non-trivial. However, they might vary substantially across countries and cannot account fully for delayed parenthood advantage as argued in some previous research. I also show that the magnitude of child\u2019s birth year effects is critical for identifying the shape of parenthood age effects and thus qualitatively different conclusions about optimal childbearing age.",

    "description": "This text questions the \u2018theoretical hegemony\u2019 that seems to characterize the concept of resistance when it comes to assessing a challenge to the social organization or its guardians. Refusal, which is presented here as a form of constructive defiance, in fact proves to be just as relevant for this purpose, particularly when it comes to understanding collective actions that are non-confrontational but express a critique of the order of things. This is what the ethnography of utopian collectives established in the French countryside tends to show. The women and men who compose them, individually driven by the desire to \u2018no longer play the game\u2019, slip collectively, on certain occasions, into the interstices of the social order, acting together in order to refuse certain of its social, political and economic norms. Their ways of doing things and the social relationships they then form can prefigure certain features of a \u2018different future\u2019.",

    "link": "https://share.osf.io/preprint/E0030-427-352",
    "description": "Transdisciplinary sustainability science is increasingly applied to study transformative change. Yet, transdisciplinary research involves diverse actors who hold contrasting and sometimes conflicting perspectives and worldviews. Reflexivity is cited as a crucial capacity for navigating the resulting challenges, yet notions of reflexivity are often focused on individual researcher reflections that lack explicit links to the collective transdisciplinary research process and predominant modes of inquiry in the field. This gap presents the risk that reflexivity remains on the periphery of sustainability science and becomes \u2018unreflexive\u2019, as crucial dimensions are left unacknowledged. Our objective was to establish a framework for reflexivity as a transformative capacity in sustainability science through a critical systems approach. We developed and refined the framework through a rapid scoping review of literature on transdisciplinarity, transformation, and reflexivity, and reflection on a scenario study in the Red River Basin (US, Canada). The framework characterizes reflexivity as the capacity to nurture a dynamic, embedded, and collective process of self-scrutiny and mutual learning in service of transformative change, which manifests through interacting boundary processes \u2013 boundary delineation, interaction, and transformation. The case study reflection suggests how embedding this framework in research can expose boundary processes that block transformation and nurture more reflexive and transformative research.",

    "description": "While prior research has widely acknowledged the consequences of specific family transitions (e.g., parental death, parenthood, grandparenthood) for individual wealth holdings, the interplay of multiple family transitions and positions occurring at different life stages and in various orderings has received little attention. This is despite the fact that these transitions and positions most likely jointly shape wealth accumulation, both in the shorter and longer run. We apply (1) sequence analysis to identify typical family life course clusters defined by the timing of the death of the parent generation, the timing of the transition into parenthood, and grandparenthood, and (2) regression analysis to describe how the accumulation of wealth between ages 40 and 64 differs by family life course cluster. Using Norwegian register data of individuals born in 1953 (N=47,945), we identified six clusters of family trajectories ranging from childless individuals to individuals who were sandwiched between their parents, children, and grandchildren because of relatively early (grand)parenthood and late parental death. Individuals experiencing patterns with a later transition into (grand)parenthood occupied stable and high wealth positions over time. Individuals without children exhibited a steady increase in their wealth position. Additionally, experiencing parental death later in life was associated with increasing wealth, whereas early parental death was not. These results held net of gender and education. Pronounced and even increasing wealth differences over the life course seem to be associated with the interplay of multiple family transitions.",

We conceptualize the aggregate effect of these changes as a period effect to be identified in a framework of age-period-cohort (APC) analysis. Upon evaluation of previous research, we argue that the secular trend is challenging to identify directly both for empirical and theoretical reasons. However, using Fosse and Winship\u2019s bounding approach to APC analysis, we show that the challenge can be resolved indirectly, and identify a declining period trend under an intuitive and theoretically warranted assumption that crime concerns are unlikely to decrease from late adolescence into adulthood.",

New, nearby affordable housing causes majority-homeowner blocks to increase their support for the housing bond, while majority-renter blocks decrease or do not change their support. We attribute the positive effect among homeowners to the housing's replacement of blight. In contrast, the lack of a positive effect among renters may be driven by the threat of gentrification. Policy implementation can win support for expansion among unexpected beneficiaries, while failing to do so even among the policy\u2019s presumed allies.",

A brief overview of the characteristics of these programs is presented as a comparison tool. In all, 16 national programs were identified across five continents. The results highlight the existence of OPL qualification programs in a variety of geographical and cultural contexts, with a significant concentration in Europe. The study offers a discussion of the challenges encountered in identifying these programs, due to the diversity of program names and qualification objectives. Despite certain methodological limitations, this study constitutes, to our knowledge, an important first step towards a better understanding of OPL training and qualification worldwide, offering avenues for future research in the field and opening the door for applications in the practical domain.",

    "description": "The initial emergence of complex societies in the archaeological record has often been explained by cultural and environmental conditions. In this paper, we formally test whether the conditions of the highly circumscribed region of the Valley of Oaxaca in highland Mexico could have intensified the formation of social complexity. The Valley of Oaxaca shows some of the earliest evidence for territorial expansion and multiple levels of internal organisation, or social complexity, in Mesoamerica and is considered a classic example of the effects of environmental circumscription. We build on our previous abstract agent-based model (Williams and Mesoudi, submitted) by incorporating real-world archaeological and environmental data from the Valley of Oaxaca to explore social complexity formation and test the impact of factors for which there is little archaeological evidence. The model results suggest that the mountainous surroundings of the valley could have contributed to social complexity formation, if we assume warfare was present throughout the time periods. However, the model also suggests that observed differences in social complexity formation between the three subvalleys of the Valley of Oaxaca were unlikely to be due to differences in circumscribing conditions. The model highlights key forms of archaeological evidence that might confirm or reject the effect of geographical circumscription in the Valley of Oaxaca.",

    "description": "Objectives: The study examined whether transition to retirement was associated with changes in social networks and social participation, and whether these changes differed by gender, partnership status or European region. Methods: Data were derived from fourth and sixth rounds of the Survey of Health, Ageing and Retirement in Europe (SHARE), collected with a 3\u20135-year interval from 14 European countries. The sample involved 12,885 individuals aged 50\u201379 (mean age 58) at the initial timepoint. Fixed-effects regression models were used to estimate within-person changes over time. Results: The results showed changes in the size and composition of social network, contact frequency with close network members, and the intensity of social participation. The most consistent change was a decrease in the presence of colleagues within the close network. By contrast, the number of relatives in the network, total frequency of social contacts, and satisfaction with the close network remained rather stable. Discussion: The retirement transition is associated with predominantly positive changes in social relationships. While relationships with colleagues fade, they are compensated by other close connections or intensified social participation, or both. However, the patterns of change vary substantially across sub-populations and geographic regions. Interaction with relatives remains mostly unaffected by retirement, demonstrating the resilience of these relationships to contextual changes.",

This article presents a study of the Reddit incel community, active from mid-2016 to its ban in late 2017, which evolved from a self-help forum to a hub for extremist ideologies. We use computational grounded theory to deduce empirical patterns in forum composition, psychological states reflected in language use, and semantic content before refining and testing an interactional process that explains this change: a shift away from drawing on real-world experiences in discussion toward a greater reliance on cognitively simple symbols of group membership. This shift, in turn, leads to more discussions centered on deviant ideology. The results confirm that understanding the dynamics of conversation\u2014specifically, how ideas are interpreted, reinforced, and amplified in recurrent, person-to-person interactions\u2014is crucial for understanding cultural change in digital communities.

Using causal inference methods, we analyze the 1996, 2006, and 2018 General Social Survey National Stigma Studies. We find that (1) an inferred mental illness label affects desired social distance, (2) the likelihood and effect of inferring a label differs across mental illnesses, and (3) causal inference methods that exact match on contact better approximate the causal effect of inferring a label. These findings underline the importance of clearly identifying effects of interest and causal methods\u2019 utility for estimating these effects.",

    "description": "Dreams offer a unique window into the cognitive and affective dynamics of the sleeping and the waking mind. Recent quantitative linguistic approaches have shown promise in obtaining corpus-level measures of dream sentiment and topic occurrence. However, it is currently unclear how the affective content of individual dreams relates to their semantic content and structure. Here, we combine word embedding, topic modeling, and network analysis to investigate this relationship. By applying Discourse Atom Topic Modeling (DATM) to the DreamBank corpus of >18K dream reports, we represent the latent themes arising within dreams as a sparse dictionary of topics and identify the affective associations of those topics. We show that variation in dream affect (valence and arousal) is associated with changes in topical content. By representing each dream report as a network of topics, we demonstrate that the affective content of dreams is also coupled to semantic structure. Specifically, positively valenced dreams exhibit more coherent, structured, and linear narratives, whilst negatively valenced dreams have more narrative loops and dominant topics. Additionally, topic networks of high arousal dreams are structurally dominated by few high arousal topics and incoherent topical connections, whereas low arousal dreams contain more loops. These findings suggest that affective processes are associated with both the content and structure of dreams. Our approach showcases the potential of integrating natural language processing and network analysis with psychology to elucidate the interplay of affect, cognition and narrative in dreams. This methodology has broad applications for the study of narrated experience and psychiatric symptomatology.",

    "description": "Social media platforms such as TikTok hold tremendous promise for reaching large proportions of the general population with health messaging. However, the proliferation of health misinformation on these platforms poses a significant public health risk. Partnerships between public health experts and social media content creators are a novel intervention which may overcome concerns about misinformation and catalyze the proliferation of evidence-based health messages on social media. To build such partnerships between creators and mental health and health communication experts, The Center for Health Communication (CHC) at the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health held an in-person summit that attracted mental health creators working on TikTok and other social media platforms. Over the course of two days, creators were exposed to techniques for communicating evidence-based research and recommendations that promote mental health. Following the summit, creators who attended the summit were re-contacted for in-depth interviews to assess the summit's impact on their beliefs and behaviors. Results reveal that attending the summit changed creators\u2019 content-making behaviors, increased their sense of responsibility and awareness of their power to impact mental health outcomes among social media users, validated their work and motivation as health communicators, and created a much-needed community of support among peers.

    "description": "This study aims to trace the cause of an emerging welfare cleavage under circumstances where discourses on economic growth have been dominant in Korean politics. On the basis of the theories of interaction between changing social structure and social-norm dynamics, this paper explores the causes of an emerging welfare cleavage in the case of South Korea during the late 2000s. To analyze the change of economic structure and public awareness regarding public welfare, I used the data of macro-economic indicators and public opinion polls and utilized press releases to analyze discourses of political actors. The linked-policies effects of an immature \u201cdevelopmental welfare regime\u201d and neo-liberal economic policies caused social polarization and expansion of the poverty stratum in the course of a slowdown in economic growth in the 1990s and foreign exchange crisis in 1998. The existing norm (i.e., economic growth could solve problems concerning people's livelihood) that had been maintained in the era of rapid economic growth was weakened. A conflict between an education superintendent and the Gyeonggi-do Provincial Council triggered a debate on free meals and welfare in 2009. Civil society groups were organized on a national scale, and they started a discourse struggle to replace individual interests with public interests and to obtain social legitimacy. Political parties gradually accepted the welfare issue as the primary electoral pledge for their political interests after public preference regarding growth and distribution changed when confronted with political crises. This study draws an implication that general factors affecting Western welfare states (e.g., power alliance and democratic institutions) influence East Asian welfare states by analyzing the case of South Korean welfare politics. It means that studies of East Asian welfare states can use explanatory building blocks partly from existing welfare theories rather than stressing the exceptionalism of East Asian welfare states. However, owing to the different economic and political structures of East Asian states from those of Western countries during the formative stage of welfare states, studies of East Asian welfare states need to consider path dependency in the historical context of East Asian political economy.",

    "link": "https://share.osf.io/preprint/E01D6-E26-F32",
    "description": "Lone mothers have been found to report lower average mental health than partnered mothers. Following the \u2018stress process model\u2019, disparities in women\u2019s mental health by family structure could be explained by lone mothers\u2019 higher exposure to multiple forms of stressors, compared to partnered mothers. Yet, this hypothesis has not been tested in previous studies. This study analysed four waves of longitudinal data from the Growing Up in Ireland study, spanning between the year when women gave birth (2008) to nine years later (2017) (N = 5,654 women), to examine how family stressors (i.e., financial strain, caregiving strain, work-related strain, and parental conflict) influence women\u2019s depressive symptoms by family structure. Analyses applied random-effects models and Karlson-Holm-Breen (KHB) decomposition techniques, combined with different model specifications as robustness checks (i.e., fixed-effects). Results indicate that: (1) net of sociodemographic factors, lone mothers experience higher levels of depressive symptoms than partnered mothers, with additional analyses confirming that transitioning from partnered to lone mother is associated with higher depressive symptoms, and from lone to partnered mother with reduced depressive symptoms; (2) although 41% of the observed statistical association between family structure and mothers\u2019 depressive symptoms is direct, a larger 59% of this mental health gap is mediated by inequalities between lone and partnered mothers in their exposure to family stressors; and (3) the largest share of the observed mediation by family stressors is explained by lone mothers\u2019 higher risks of current and past caregiving strain and parental conflict, but also by their current higher financial strain. Overall, this study suggests that lone mothers\u2019 lower mental health, compared to partnered mothers, is largely explained by disparities in exposure to family stressors, pointing to how accumulated caregiving and parental stressors, as well as poverty risks, are key explanatory factors behind the mental well-being disadvantage that lone mothers face.",

I utilize the EPI scores, protest data, public opinion data and party manifestos.

    "description": "Resource shortages unfold unequally, often affecting the most socially disadvantaged people and exacerbating preexisting inequalities. Given that most resources are obtained through organizations, what role do organizational processes play in amplifying inequalities during shortages? I argue that workers engage in a practice I term flexible austerity. Flexible austerity describes how resource shortages become opportunities for decision-makers to more readily rationalize unequal resource allocation. I develop this concept by drawing on an ethnography of an urban academic hospital and leveraging data from before and during a nationwide shortage of medical intravenous (IV) opioids. I show that prior to this shortage, clinicians disproportionately assessed Black patients\u2019 pain as \u201cundeserving\u201d of IV opioids, but they allocated these resources liberally because they felt constrained by evidence-based clinical best practices guidelines. During the shortage, clinicians constructed resource scarcity as necessitating austerity practices when treating Black patients, yet they exercised flexibility with White patients. This widened care disparities in ways that may have been detrimental to Black patients\u2019 health. Based on these findings, I argue that resource shortages amplify inequalities in organizations because they provide new \u201ccolorblind\u201d justifications for withholding resources that allow workers to link ideas of deservingness to allocation decisions.",

By combining research on societal conflicts, gender equality, and social media use, we show that extensive use of social media (Facebook, YouTube, Twitter, and Instagram) is significantly linked to regressive gender equality attitudes. The survey assesses gender equality in the labor market, LGBT rights, and perceptions of feminists. Linear regressions reveal that intense social media usage is associated with more regressive attitudes on these issues. We apply manifold sensitivity checks and demonstrate that our results remain robust against various model specifications. We discuss potential reasons why intense social media usage may trigger resentments against gender equality in Europe.",

    "description": "This paper reports findings from a crowdsourced replication. Eighty-five independent teams attempted a computational replication of results reported in an original study of policy preferences and immigration by fitting the same statistical models to the same data. The replication involved an experimental condition. Random assignment put participating teams into either the transparent group that received the original study and code, or the opaque group receiving only a methods section, rough results description and no code. The transparent group mostly verified the numerical results of the original study with the same sign and p-value threshold (95.7%), while the opaque group had less success (89.3%). Exact numerical reproductions to the second decimal place were far less common (76.9% and 48.1%), and the number of teams who verified at least 95% of all effects in all models they ran was 79.5% and 65.2% respectively. Therefore, the reliability we quantify depends on how reliability is defined, but most definitions suggest it would take a minimum of three independent replications to achieve reliability. Qualitative investigation of the teams\u2019 workflows reveals many causes of error including mistakes and procedural variations. Although minor error across researchers is not surprising, we show this occurs where it is least expected in the case of computational reproduction. Even when we curate the results to boost ecological validity, the error remains large enough to undermine reliability between researchers to some extent. The presence of inter-researcher variability may explain some of the current \u201creliability crisis\u201d in the social sciences because it may be undetected in all forms of research involving data analysis. The obvious implication of our study is more transparency. Broader implications are that researcher variability adds an additional meta-source of error that may not derive from conscious measurement or modeling decisions, and that replications cannot alone resolve this type of uncertainty.",

We analyze the drivers of this distribution, finding that life-cycle effects have limited explanatory power. In contrast, bequest motives are associated with higher wealth, and a marginal increase in the share of decedents with bequest motives reduces inequality. Homeownership also correlates with higher wealth (the reverse is true for care-home residency), though housing wealth does not benefit the bottom of the distribution across districts. Finally, means-tested long-term care transfers significantly amplify terminal wealth inequality. (Stone Center on Socio-Economic Inequality Working Paper)",

This article contributes to these debates\u2014as well as to debates regarding the role of old and new media in collective action\u2014by examining whether and how Radio T\u00e9l\u00e9vision Libre des Mille Collines (Radio RTLM) coverage was associated with two core aspects of the violence: (1) subnational onset of genocidal violence and (2) participation in genocidal violence across subnational spaces. Drawing on new data on Radio RTLM coverage, we find that areas with coverage were more likely to experience immediate onset of violence. However, our analysis of participation in the genocide\u2014which uses more accurate measures of participation and of radio coverage than prior studies\u2014finds no significant association between Radio RTLM coverage and subnational levels of participation. After illustrating that these results are robust to numerous model specifications, we theorize that information broadcast over the radio\u2019s airways contributed to the creation of a critical mass that initiated genocide in localized spaces.

Before the global financial crisis of 2007-2008, private commercial and investment banks arguably constituted the core of global finance and exerted an outsized influence. However, the crisis initiated a shift in the power distribution and actors\u2019 constellations within global finance. This new era was arguably marked by a relative decline of big banking groups \u2013 and the concomitant rise of large asset management firms (e.g., BlackRock) and other emerging influential actors such as index providers (e.g., MSCI). In parallel, the traditional center of gravity of global finance, which revolved around the axis between New York and London, was complemented and also partly challenged by the ascent of new actors such as sovereign wealth funds and financial markets from the Global South, above all China. These new actors often follow a somewhat different logic than the frequently short-term oriented and primarily profit-driven financial market actors from the Anglo-American core, since they are often permeated by government interests and consequently aimed at incorporating long-term strategic goals.",

I suggest using a method originally designed to measure residential segregation to quantify the amount of balkanization in media use at the country, party, and individual levels.

Our results reveal a significant rise in extortions within 6 months of a leadership removal in a municipality, while kidnappings show no significant change.

    "description": "In many areas of life, people who search for expert advice can now obtain it through algorithmic expert services. With these services, expert advice is generated by an algorithmic system and provided over a digital interface. Human experts disappear from direct interaction with clients, but instead orchestrate the algorithmic generation of expert advice from the back office of these services. Algorithmic expert services are often associated with the hope of making expert advice available to a large number of clients in a profitable way. However, this expectation is challenged by research on the role of shared expert values in and around organizations. In this study, we therefore explore how human experts in the back office of algorithmic expert services deal with tensions between their expert values and the imperative of scaling. Empirically, we draw on ethnographic material from a startup developing an algorithmic expert service for agriculture. We find that the human experts in the back office experience tension between their core value (i.e., reducing the environmental damages caused by pesticides) and managerial demands to maximize the app\u2019s user retention. The experts navigate this tension by constantly experimenting with new representations of advice in the app\u2019s interface, a process in which they repeatedly embrace their core value while simultaneously reinterpreting it, until they eventually find a way of representing advice that accommodates both their core value and the monopolistic tendencies of digital capitalism. Our study thus contributes to debates about whether expert advice can be scaled up by organizations using algorithmic means, and the role of values therein.",

    "description": "According to a popular argument in economics, the gender wage gap persists not because of employer discrimination against women, but because of the differential investment of fathers and mothers into paid work and the household. We test this argument by comparing the evolution of wages between men and women before the onset of family formation and gendered household specialization. We use a cohort study of young adults for Switzerland (TREE 2000\u20132014) and match the two sexes on their intellectual ability and educational attainment before they enter the labour market. We then use the ensuing survey waves to account for human capital and job characteristics as well as for values towards work and family. We replicate our analysis with a second panel study of Swiss graduate students. We find in both cohort studies an unexplained gender wage gap of between 3 to 6 percent in favour of men. This result suggests that young women earn lower wages than young men with the same productive characteristics long before they have children. Translated into annual wages, this means that young women lose out on half a monthly wage each year in comparison to young men.",

A key feature of the genetics and genomics landscape has been attention to the importance of patient and public views \u2013 from the development of genomic research databases and UK Biobank through to ongoing policy recognition of, and commitment to, public engagement and dialogue. Despite the growing emphasis on public engagement within the field of genetics and genomics, there remains a significant gap in our understanding of how dialogic engagement - characterised by reciprocal communication and mutual learning - can be effectively measured and evaluated. Existing studies have predominantly focused on public attitudes, knowledge, and participation in genetics, yet they often overlook the deeper, qualitative dimensions of engagement that dialogue-based approaches seek to foster. Moreover, while models of public engagement have been widely discussed, there is a paucity of research that specifically addresses the unique challenges and opportunities presented by dialogic methods within the context of genetics and genomics. This study aims to address these gaps by developing a robust model and corresponding measures that capture the nuanced and dynamic nature of dialogic public engagement in this field, thereby providing a more comprehensive framework for evaluating the effectiveness of such initiatives.",

In this preregistered study, we sent out N = 3,002 applications to job vacancies in Germany and measured real-world responses. Eight weeks later, we presented nearly identical applicant profiles to the same employers as a part of an FS. To explore the conditions under which FSs provide valid behavioral predictions, we varied the topic sensitivity and tested whether behavioral predictions were more successful after filtering out respondents who gave socially desirable answers or did not exert sufficient effort when answering FS vignettes. Across conditions, the FS results did not correspond well with the real-world benchmark.

Previous research has suggested a list of desiderata, such as that the system: reduces poverty; reduces inequality; improves mental and physical health; costs little; and rewards only the deserving. How do these different features trade off against one another to determine overall desirability? We conducted a conjoint survey experiment with 800 UK-resident adults, presenting them with hypothetical welfare schemes that varied on a large number of attributes. The strongest driver of choice was the effect on poverty: people were more likely to choose a scheme the more it reduced poverty. Respondents were prepared to trade off their preference for lower income taxes: even for centre-right voters, some income tax rises would be acceptable in exchange for sufficiently large reductions in poverty. Taxes on wealth and carbon emissions were positively valued. Respondents paid some attention to the effects of schemes on inequality and health. Preferences over institutional design features to do with deservingness, such as means testing, conditionality and universality, were weak. Heterogeneity in preferences by age and political orientation were present but modest. We discuss the findings with respect to the envelope of welfare systems that would be publicly acceptable.",

    "link": "https://share.osf.io/preprint/E0196-A06-0A9",
    "description": "While there is extensive literature on intergenerational mobility in education, including the transition to PhD, much less is known about the transition to academic faculty. In this paper, we use unique register data following entire birth cohorts born from 1955 to 1985 in Norway, an egalitarian welfare state, to investigate the social origins of academic faculty. Despite free public higher education and PhD positions with competitive wages, potentially removing many barriers to entry, we find large and stable differences in the likelihood of becoming faculty members by parental education, earnings, and whether parents are faculty members. However, while the likelihood of becoming a faculty member varies widely depending on social origins, sorting into faculty positions seems to be explained mainly by differences in obtaining a PhD. Once we compare individuals with PhD educations, social origins do not seem to constitute an additional barrier to becoming a faculty member. Nevertheless, social origins influence the likelihood of obtaining a position at more prestigious institutions, and faculty members from more advantageous backgrounds have higher earnings. Thus, social origins shape academic careers beyond their effects on entering academia.",

    "description": "The debate about the characteristics and advantages of quantitative and qualitative methods is decades old. In their seminal monograph, A Tale of Two Cultures (2012, ATTC), Gary Goertz and James Mahoney argue that methods and research design practices for causal inference can be distinguished as two cultures that systematically differ from each other along 25 specific characteristics. ATTC\u2019s stated goal is a description of empirical patterns in quantitative and qualitative research. Yet, it does not include a systematic empirical evaluation as to whether the 25 are relevant and valid descriptors of applied research. In this paper, we derive five observable implications from ATTC and test the implications against a stratified random sample of 90 qualitative and 90 quantitative articles published in six journals between 1990\u20132012. Our analysis provides little support for the two-cultures hypothesis. Quantitative methods are largely implemented as described in ATTC, whereas qualitative methods are much more diverse than ATTC suggests. While some practices do indeed conform to the qualitative culture, many others are implemented in a manner that ATTC characterizes as constitutive of the quantitative culture. We find very little evidence for ATTC's anchoring of qualitative research with set-theoretic approaches to empirical social science research. The set-theoretic template only applies to a fraction of the qualitative research that we reviewed, with the majority of qualitative work incorporating different method choices.",

    "description": "Missing data are a pervasive problem in data analysis. Three common methods for addressing the problem are (a) complete-case analysis, where only units that are complete on the variables in an analysis are included; (b) weighting, where the complete cases are weighted by the inverse of an estimate of the probability of being complete; and (c) multiple imputation (MI), where missing values of the variables in the analysis are imputed as draws from their predictive distribution under an implicit or explicit statistical model, the imputation process is repeated to create multiple filled-in data sets, and analysis is carried out using simple MI combining rules. This article provides a non-technical discussion of the strengths and weakness of these approaches, and when each of the methods might be adopted over the others. The methods are illustrated on data from the Youth Cohort (Time) Series (YCS) for England, Wales and Scotland, 1984\u20132002.",

    "description": "A growing body of social science research investigates whether the economic payoff to a college education is heterogeneous \u2014 in particular, whether disadvantaged youth can benefit more from attending and completing college relative to their more advantaged peers. Scholars, however, have employed different analytical strategies and reported mixed findings. To shed light on this literature, I propose a causal mediation approach to conceptualizing, evaluating, and unpacking the causal effects of college on earnings. By decomposing the total effect of attending a four-year college into several direct and indirect components, this approach not only clarifies the mechanisms through which college attendance boosts earnings, but illuminates the ways in which the postsecondary system may be both an equalizer and a stratifier. The total effect of college attendance, its direct and indirect components, and their heterogeneity across different subpopulations are all identified under the assumption of sequential ignorability. I introduce a debiased machine learning (DML) method for estimating all quantities of interest, along with a set of bias formulas for sensitivity analysis. I illustrate the proposed framework and methodology using data from the National Longitudinal Survey of Youth, 1997 cohort.",

    "description": "The last decade witnessed a spectacular rise in the volume of available textual data. With this new abundance came the question of how to analyze it. In the social sciences, scholars mostly resorted to two well-established approaches, human annotation on sampled data on the one hand (either performed by the researcher, or outsourced to microworkers), and quantitative methods on the other. Each approach has its own merits - a potentially very fine-grained analysis for the former, a very scalable one for the latter - but the combination of these two properties has not yielded highly accurate results so far. Leveraging recent advances in sequential transfer learning, we demonstrate via an experiment that an expert can train a precise, efficient automatic classifier in a very limited amount of time. We also show that, under certain conditions, expert-trained models produce better annotations than humans themselves. We demonstrate these points using a classic research question in the sociology of journalism, the rise of a \u201chorse race\u201d coverage of politics. We conclude that recent advances in transfer learning help us augment ourselves when analyzing unstructured data.",

Both the volume of past interactions and the time that has elapsed since the past interactions affect the actors\u2019 decision-making to interact with other actors in the network. Recently occurred events may have a stronger influence on current interaction behavior than past events that occurred a long time ago\u2013a phenomenon known as \u201cmemory decay\u201d. Previous studies either predefined a short-run and long-run memory or fixed a parametric exponential memory decay using a predefined half-life period. In real-life relational event networks, however, it is generally unknown how the influence of past events fades as time goes by. For this reason, it is not recommendable to fix memory decay in an ad-hoc manner, but instead we should learn the shape of memory decay from the observed data. In this paper, a novel semi-parametric approach based on Bayesian Model Averaging is proposed for learning the shape of the memory decay without requiring any parametric assumptions. The method is applied to relational event history data among socio-political actors in India and a comparison with other relational event models based on predefined memory decays is provided.",

    "description": "The network scale-up method (NSUM) is a survey-based method for estimating the number of individuals in a hidden or hard-to-reach subgroup of a general population. In NSUM surveys, sampled individuals report how many others they know in the subpopulation of interest (e.g. \u201cHow many sex workers do you know?\u201d) and how many others they know in subpopulations of the general population (e.g. \u201cHow many bus drivers do you know?\u201d). NSUM is widely used to estimate the size of important sociological and epidemiological risk groups, including men who have sex with men, sex workers, HIV+ individuals, and drug users. Unlike several other methods for population size estimation, NSUM requires only a single random sample and the estimator has a conveniently simple form. Despite its popularity, there are no published guidelines for the minimum sample size calculation to achieve a desired statistical precision. Here, we provide a sample size formula that can be employed in any NSUM survey. We show analytically and by simulation that the sample size controls error at the nominal rate and is robust to some forms of network model mis-specification. We apply this methodology to study the minimum sample size and relative error properties of several published NSUM surveys.",

However, to what extent and under what conditions egocentric network centrality can serve as reasonable substitutes for their sociocentric counterparts are important questions to study. The answers to these questions are uncertain simply because of the large variety of networks. Hence, this paper aims to provide exploratory answers to these questions by analyzing both empirical and simulated data. Through analyses of various empirical networks (including some classic albeit small ones), this paper shows that egocentric betweenness approximates sociocentric betweenness quite well (the correlation is high across almost all the networks being examined) while egocentric closeness approximates sociocentric closeness only reasonably well (the correlation is a bit lower on average with a larger variance across networks). Simulations also confirm this finding. Analyses further show that egocentric approximations of betweenness and closeness seem to work well in different types of networks (as featured by network size, density, centralization, reciprocity, transitivity, and geodistance). Lastly, the paper briefly presents three ideas to help improve egocentric approximations of centrality measures.",

This study develops a unified regression framework for the design and optimality of GRC counts in surveys. To process infinitely many grouping schemes for the optimum design, we propose a new two-stage algorithm, the Fisher Information Maximizer (FIM), which utilizes estimates from generalized linear models to find a global optimal grouping scheme among all possible [math]-group schemes. After we define, decompose, and calculate different types of regressor-specific design errors, our analyses from both simulation and empirical examples suggest that: 1) the optimum design of GRC counts is able to reduce the grouping error to zero, 2) the performance of modified Poisson estimators using GRC counts can be comparable to that of Poisson regression, and 3) the optimum design is usually able to achieve the same estimation efficiency with a smaller sample size.",

This paper reports the results of an experiment that evaluated the additional effect of adaptive design to post-survey adjustments. The experiment was conducted in the Detroit Metro Area Communities Study in 2021. We evaluated the adaptive design in five outcomes: 1) response rates, 2) demographic composition of respondents, 3) bias and variance of key survey estimates, 4) changes in significant results of regression models, and 5) costs. The most significant benefit of the adaptive design was its ability to generate more efficient survey estimates with smaller variances and smaller design effects.",

Therefore, this study focusses on sequential-on-device-multitasking activities (SODM) and its consequences for data quality. Based on probability-based data, this study aims to reveal the prevalence of SODM based on the javascript function OnBlur, to reflect the its determinants and to examine the consequences for data quality. Results show that SODM was detected for 25% of all respondents and that respondent attributes and the device used to answer the survey are related to SODM. Moreover, it becomes apparent that SODM is significantly correlated to data quality measures. Therefore, I propose SODM behavior as a new instrument for researching suboptimal response behavior.",

Using the European Working Conditions Survey, we examine their criterion and construct validity across 31 countries and for both genders. We investigate whether classes are welldelineated by the theoretically assumed dimensions of employment relations and we assess how several measures of occupational advantage differ across classes. We find broad similarity in the criterion validity of EGP and ESEC across genders and countries as well as satisfactory levels of construct validity. However, the salariat classes are too heterogeneous and their boundaries with the intermediate classes are blurred. To improve the measurement of social class, we propose to differentiate managerial and professional occupations within the lower and higher salariat respectively. We show that implementing these distinctions in ESEC and EGP improves their criterion validity and allows to better identify privileged positions.",

The causal effect of the Great Recession is defined in terms of counterfactual developmental trajectories and can be identified under the assumption of short-term stable differences between the birth cohorts in the absence of the Great Recession. A meta-analysis aggregates the estimated effects over six between-cohort comparisons. Furthermore, we conduct a sensitivity analysis to assess the potential consequences if the identification assumption is violated.

    "description": "The estimation of RxC ecological inference contingency tables from aggregate data is one of the most salient and challenging problems in the field of quantitative social sciences, with major solutions proposed from both the ecological regression and the mathematical programming frameworks. In recent decades, there has been a drive to find solutions stemming from the former, with the latter being less active. From the mathematical programming framework, this paper suggests a new direction for tackling this problem. For the first time in the literature, a procedure based on linear programming is proposed to attain estimates of local contingency tables. Based on this and the homogeneity hypothesis, we suggest two new ecological inference algorithms. These two new algorithms represent an important step forward in the ecological inference mathematical programming literature. In addition to generating estimates for local ecological inference contingency tables and amending the tendency to produce extreme transfer probability estimates previously observed in other mathematical programming procedures, these two new algorithms prove to be quite competitive and more accurate than the current linear programming baseline algorithm. Their accuracy is assessed using a unique dataset with almost 500 elections, where the real transfer matrices are known, and their sensitivity to assumptions and limitations are gauged through an extensive simulation study. The new algorithms place the linear programming approach once again in a prominent position in the ecological inference toolkit. Interested readers can use these new algorithms easily with the aid of the R package lphom.",

We highlight three methodological problems IV faces: (i) identification bias, an asymptotic bias from assumption violations; (ii) estimation bias, a finite-sample bias that persists even when assumptions hold; and (iii) type-M error, the exaggeration of effect size given statistical significance. In each case, we emphasize how weak instruments exacerbate these problems and make results sensitive to minor violations of assumptions. We survey IV papers from top sociology journals, finding that assumptions often go unstated and robust uncertainty measures are rarely used.

    "description": "This article uses the example of voter turnout in US presidential elections to compare two new methods for age, period, and cohort (APC) analysis: the APC interaction model and the APC bounding analysis. While discussing the formal, conceptual, and interpretive differences between the two methods, the analysis demonstrates how both methods can be used to generate distinct but complementary findings. Because the two methods take alternative positions on the appropriate cohort-effect estimands, the comparison underscores the importance of well-grounded conceptual foundations in APC analysis.",

    "description": "Survey research on migrants is notoriously challenging, especially if the goal is to collect data across a range of countries. Social networking sites\u2019 ability to micro-target advertisements to migrant communities combined with their near-global reach makes them an attractive option. Yet there is little rigorous evaluation of the quality of data thus collected\u2014especially for populations from developing countries. We compare samples of Nigerian emigrants in Canada and Italy and Nigerians (at home) in Nigeria recruited through targeted advertising on Facebook and Instagram to population estimates. We find our samples contain varying degrees of bias in the case of age and gender and systematically miss those with little formal education. How much this affects our samples\u2019 representativeness varies across contexts: discrepancies are much smaller for emigrant populations in Canada than in Italy and much larger in Nigeria, where a large share of the population has little formal education and limited literacy. Post-stratifying each sample on age, gender, and education does not ameliorate bias on other variables such as ethnicity, religion, period of migration, or political attitudes. We discuss the potential and limitations of social-media-driven sampling and highlight key considerations for implementing it to collect multi-sited data on migrants.",

Despite promising developments in causal decomposition analysis, current methods are limited to addressing a time-fixed mediator and outcome only, which has restricted our understanding of the causal mechanisms underlying social disparities. In particular, existing approaches largely overlook individual characteristics when designing (hypothetical) interventions to reduce disparities. To address this issue, we extend current longitudinal mediation approaches to the context of disparities research. Specifically, we develop a novel decomposition analysis method that addresses individual characteristics by (a) using optimal dynamic treatment regimes (DTRs) and (b) conditioning on a selective set of individual characteristics. Incorporating optimal DTRs into the design of interventions can be used to strike a balance between equity (reducing disparities) and excellence (improving individuals\u2019 outcomes). We illustrate the proposed method using the High School Longitudinal Study data.",

These are increasingly debated, potentially undermining large swathes of empirical evidence. Drawing on a combination of open-ended probing data, supervised machine learning, and a U.S. representative quota sample, our study compares the validity of standard measures of generalized social trust with more recent, situation-specific measures of trust. We find that survey measures that refer to \u201cstrangers\u201d in their question wording best reflect the concept of generalized trust, also known as trust in unknown others. While situation-specific measures should have the desirable property of further reducing variation in associations, that is, producing more similar frames of reference across respondents, they also seem to increase associations with known others, which is undesirable. In addition, we explore to what extent trust survey questions may evoke negative associations. We find that there is indeed variation across measures, which calls for more research.",

However, an extended series of simulation experiments on fuzzy-set data reveals that, when mixed with fragmentation or noise, data imbalances may substantially impair CNA\u2019s performance. Furthermore, we find that the performance impairment is higher when endogenous factors are imbalanced than when exogenous factors are concerned. Our results allow us to quantify these impacts and demarcate degrees at which data imbalances should be considered as problematic.

In this article, we attempt to bridge this divide by merging the conceptual language from the productive/generative account of mechanisms with realist ideas to develop what we term social process tracing (SPT) as a practical research method that captures both the moves performed by actors, the meanings they ascribe to them, and how the underlying social context shapes how social causal processes play out in real-world cases.

The resulting index is the occupational percentile rank for a given cohort, based on contemporaneous information pertaining to educational composition and the number of workers at the occupation level. An occupation may experience an increase or decrease in its occupational rank due to changes in relative sizes and educational compositions across occupations. The method is flexible in dealing with changes in occupational and educational measurements over time. Applying the method to U.S. history from the mid-nineteenth century to the present day, we derive the index using IPUMS U.S. Census microdata from 1850 to 2000 and the American Community Surveys (ACSs) from 2001 to 2018. Compared to previous occupational measures, this new measure takes into account occupational status evolvement caused by long-term secular changes in occupational size and educational composition. The resulting percentile rank measure can be easily merged with social surveys and administrative data that include occupational measures based on the U.S. Census occupation codes and crosswalks.",

We assessed the relative performance of seven high-dimensional MI methods with a Monte Carlo simulation study and a resampling study based on real survey data. The performance of the methods was defined by the degree to which they facilitate unbiased and confidence-valid estimates of the parameters of complete data analysis models. We found that using lasso penalty or forward selection to select the predictors used in the MI model and using principal component analysis to reduce the dimensionality of auxiliary data produce the best results.",

We contrast three methods of estimating precinct racial composition, Bayesian Improved Surname Geocoding (BISG), fully Bayesian BISG, and Citizen Voting Age Population (CVAP), and two algorithms for performing ecological inference (EI), King\u2019s EI and EI:RxC using eiCompare. Using data from two different elections we identify circumstances in which different combinations of methods produce divergent results, comparing against ground-truth data where available. We first find that BISG outperforms CVAP at estimating racial composition, though fully Bayesian BISG does not yield further improvements. Next, in a statewide election, we find that all combinations of methods yield similarly reliable estimates of RPV. However, county-level analyses and results from a non-partisan school board election reveal that BISG and CVAP produce divergent estimates of Black preferences in elections with low turnout and few precincts. Our results suggest that methodological choices can meaningfully alter conclusions about RPV, particularly in smaller, low-turnout elections.",

When attrition is related to the event, it precludes consistent estimation of the impacts of covariates on the event and on event probabilities in the absence of additional assumptions. The paper introduces an adjustment procedure based on Bayes Theorem that directly addresses the problem of nonignorable dropout. It uses population information external to the survey sample to convert estimates of event probabilities and marginal effects of covariates on them that are conditional on retention in the longitudinal data to unconditional estimates of these quantities. In many plausible and verifiable circumstances, it produces estimates of the marginal effect of covariates closer to the true unconditional quantities than the conditional estimates obtained from estimation using the survey data alone.",

To allow researchers to pool rating data across alternative question formats, the article provides a generalization of the ordered logit model that accommodates multiple scale formats in the measurement of a single rating construct. The resulting multiscale ordered logit model shares the interpretation as well as the proportional odds (or parallel lines) assumption with the standard ordered logit model. A further extension to relax the proportional odds assumption in the multiscale context is proposed, and the substitution of the logit with other convenient link functions is equally straightforward. The utility of the model is illustrated from an empirical analysis of the determinants of respondents\u2019 confidence in democratic institutions that combines data from the European Social Survey, the General Social Survey, and the European and World Values Survey series.",

Our derived mathematical model fits significantly better to the experimentally observed attitude changes than the neutral argument processing assumption made in previous models. Our approach provides new insight into the relationship between biased processing and opinion polarization. Our analysis reveals a sharp qualitative transition from attitude moderation to polarization at the individual level.

We advance sociological research by introducing (random) regret minimization, which is related to loss aversion, into the sociological literature and by testing it against (random) utility maximization, which is the most prominent decision rule in sociological research on individual behaviour. With an application to neighbourhood choice, in a sample of four European cities, we combine stated choice experiment data and discrete choice modelling techniques and find a considerable degree of decision rule-heterogeneity, with a strong prevalence of regret minimization and hence loss aversion. We also provide indicative evidence that decision rules can affect expected neighbourhood demand at the macro level. Our approach allows identifying heterogeneity in decision rules, that is, the degree of regret/loss aversion, at the level of choice attributes such as the share of foreigners when comparing neighbourhoods, and can improve sociological practice related to linking theories and social research on decision-making.",

Embedding open-ended probes resulted in higher levels of survey break off, as well as increased backtracking and answer changes to previous questions.

For continuous distributions, the Gini index can be computed using several equivalent formulations.

We attempt to bring a better understanding of the underlying problem by regrouping and classifying the most common estimators of the Gini index proposed in both infinite and finite populations, and focusing on the biases. We use Monte Carlo simulation studies to analyse the bias of the various estimators under a wide range of scenarios. Extremely large biases are observed in heavy-tailed distributions with high Gini indices, and bias corrections are recommended in this situation. We propose the use of some (new and traditional) bootstrap-based and jackknife-based strategies to mitigate this bias problem. Results are based on continuous distributions often used in the modelling of income distributions. We describe a simulation-based criterion for deciding when to use bias corrections. Various real data sets are used to illustrate the practical application of the suggested bias corrected procedures.",

Through interviews with 31 ethnographers whose access was preempted or eliminated, I find that adaptation varied systematically based on when during the fieldwork process researchers' access was disrupted. The timing of the disruption shaped the relevance and implications of common conditions that affect fieldwork, such as funding availability, institutionalized time constraints, and sunk costs. Consequently, despite a lack of common conventions or training in how to adapt to losing access, adaptations took one of three general forms, which I refer to as turning home, pivoting, and following. I highlight specific challenges associated with each of these forms and offer insights for navigating them. Building from my findings, I make the case that the logistics of being flexible and adapting are part of a hidden curriculum in qualitative methods, and I discuss how interrogating the conditions that structure these aspects of fieldwork advances research and pedagogy in qualitative methodology.",

More specifically, I show first why longitudinal case disaggregation should be carried out with change-based intervals (CBIs) rather than with fixed intervals. Second, I develop a flexible lag condition (FLC) that (i) resolves two types of temporal contradictions and outcome redundancies that can result from temporal case disaggregation and (ii) allows to measure the average duration it takes for a combination of conditions to translate to an outcome. Since temporal contradictions and outcome redundancies are most likely with an increasing number of time points and conditions, as well as with CBIs in general, the FLC procedure is most useful in these cases. The fact that the interest of longitudinal analyses increases with the number of disaggregated cases underlines the usefulness of the proposed methodological innovation. Despite its suitability for mid-n and large-n analyses, longitudinal QCA with an FLC preserves a strong case-oriented and qualitative perspective and remains thereby loyal to QCA's original foundations.",

    "description": "The rise of social media has opened countless opportunities to explore social science questions with new data and methods. However, research on socioeconomic inequality remains constrained by limited individual-level socioeconomic status (SES) measures in digital trace data. Following Bourdieu, we argue that the commercial and entertainment accounts Twitter users follow reflect their economic and cultural capital. Adapting a political science method for inferring political ideology, we use correspondence analysis to estimate the SES of 3,482,652 Twitter users who follow the accounts of 339 brands in the United States. We validate our estimates with data from the Facebook Marketing application programming interface, self-reported job titles on users\u2019 Twitter profiles, and a small survey sample. The results show reasonable correlations with the standard proxies for SES, alongside much weaker or nonsignificant correlations with other demographic variables. The proposed method opens new opportunities for innovative social research on inequality on Twitter and similar online platforms.",

    "description": "Multilevel models are often used to account for the hierarchical structure of social data and the inherent dependencies to produce estimates of regression coefficients, variance components associated with each level, and accurate standard errors. Social network analysis is another important approach to analysing complex data that incoproate the social relationships between a number of individuals. Extended linear regression models, such as network autoregressive models, have been proposed that include the social network information to account for the dependencies between persons. In this article, we propose three types of models that account for both the multilevel structure and the social network structure together, leading to network autoregressive multilevel models. We investigate theoretically and empirically, using simulated data and a data set from the Dutch Social Behavior study, the effect of omitting the levels and the social network on the estimates of the regression coefficients, variance components, network autocorrelation parameter, and standard errors.",

    "description": "In the United States and elsewhere, risk assessment algorithms are being used to help inform criminal justice decision-makers. A common intent is to forecast an offender\u2019s \u201cfuture dangerousness.\u201d Such algorithms have been correctly criticized for potential unfairness, and there is an active cottage industry trying to make repairs. In this paper, we use counterfactual reasoning to consider the prospects for improved fairness when members of a disadvantaged class are treated by a risk algorithm as if they are members of an advantaged class. We combine a machine learning classifier trained in a novel manner with an optimal transport adjustment for the relevant joint probability distributions, which together provide a constructive response to claims of bias-in-bias-out. A key distinction is made between fairness claims that are empirically testable and fairness claims that are not. We then use confusion tables and conformal prediction sets to evaluate achieved fairness for estimated risk. Our data are a random sample of 300,000 offenders at their arraignments for a large metropolitan area in the United States during which decisions to release or detain are made. We show that substantial improvement in fairness can be achieved consistently with a Pareto improvement for legally protected classes.",

The article argues that the in-depth discussion and reconciliation initiated by IRR may enhance the findings and theory that emerges from qualitative case study data analysis, where the main data source is often interview transcripts or field notes. To achieve this, the article provides a missing link in the literature between data gathering and analysis by expanding an existing process model from five to six stages.

    "description": "Policy evaluation studies, which assess the effect of an intervention, face statistical challenges: in real-world settings treatments are not randomly assigned and the analysis might be complicated by the presence of interference among units. Researchers have started to develop methods that allow to manage spillovers in observational studies; recent works focus primarily on binary treatments. However, many studies deal with more complex interventions. For instance, in political science, evaluating the impact of policies implemented by administrative entities often implies a multi-valued approach, as a policy towards a specific issue operates at many levels and can be defined along multiple dimensions. In this work, we extend the statistical framework about causal inference under network interference in observational studies, allowing for a multi-valued individual treatment and an interference structure shaped by a weighted network. The estimation strategy relies on a joint multiple generalized propensity score and allows one to estimate direct effects, controlling for both individual and network covariates. We follow this methodology to analyze the impact of the national immigration policy on the crime rate, analyzing data of 22 OECD countries over a thirty-years time frame. We define a multi-valued characterization of political attitude towards migrants and we assume that the extent to which each country can be influenced by another country is modeled by an indicator, summarizing their cultural and geographical proximity. Results suggest that implementing a highly restrictive immigration policy leads to an increase of the crime rate and the estimated effect is larger if we account for interference.",

Digital data provide granular information on time and space, but do not draw from representative samples of the population, leading to biased estimates. We propose a method for combining digital data and official statistics by using the official statistics to model the spatial and temporal dependence structure of the biases of digital data. We use simulations to demonstrate the validity of the model, then empirically illustrate our approach by combining geo-located Twitter data with data from the American Community Survey (ACS) to estimate state-level out-migration probabilities in the United States. We show that our model, which combines unbiased and biased data, produces predictions that are more accurate than predictions based solely on unbiased data. Our approach demonstrates how digital data can be used to complement, rather than replace, official statistics.",

However, the analysis of discrete-time survival data is challenged by missing data in one or more covariates. Negative consequences of missing covariate data include efficiency losses and possible bias. A popular approach to circumventing these consequences is multiple imputation (MI). In MI, it is crucial to include outcome information in the imputation models. As there is little guidance on how to incorporate the observed outcome information into the imputation model of missing covariates in DTSA, we explore different existing approaches using fully conditional specification (FCS) MI and substantive-model compatible (SMC)-FCS MI. We extend SMC-FCS for DTSA and provide an implementation in the smcfcs R package. We compare the approaches using Monte Carlo simulations and demonstrate a good performance of the new approach compared to existing approaches.",

To enable social scientists to leverage these potential benefits for their research, this article explains how these methods work, why they might be advantageous, and what their limitations are. Additionally, three Transformer-based models for transfer learning, BERT, RoBERTa, and the Longformer, are compared to conventional machine learning algorithms on three applications. Across all evaluated tasks, textual styles, and training data set sizes, the conventional models are consistently outperformed by transfer learning with Transformers, thereby demonstrating the benefits these models can bring to text-based social science research.",

But like any tool, they build on and exert theoretical assumptions. In this paper, I theorize the ways in which word embeddings model three core premises of a structural linguistic theory of meaning: that meaning is coherent, relational, and may be analyzed as a static system. In certain ways, word embeddings are vulnerable to the enduring critiques of these premises. In other ways, word embeddings offer novel solutions to these critiques. More broadly, formalizing the study of meaning with word embeddings offers theoretical opportunities to clarify core concepts and debates in cultural sociology, such as the coherence of meaning. Just as network analysis specified the once vague notion of social relations, formalizing meaning with embeddings can push us to specify and reimagine meaning itself.",

In this study, we compare measurement quality in an experiment of three distinct survey designs implemented in the German sample of the European Values Study: a single-mode face-to-face design, a mixed-mode mail/web design, and a shorter (matrix) questionnaire in the mixed-mode design. We compare measurement quality in different ways, including differences in distributions across several data quality indicators as well as equivalence testing over 140 items in 25 attitudinal scales. We find similar data quality across the survey designs, although the mixed-mode survey shows more item nonresponse compared to the single-mode survey. Using equivalence testing we find that most scales achieve metric equivalence and, to a lesser extent, scalar equivalence across the designs.",

Causal claims from process tracing are re-expressed in terms of so-called hypothetical interventions, and concrete evidential tests are proposed which are shown to corroborate process tracing claims. In particular, three steps are prescribed for an interventionist investigation, and each step in turn is shown to make the causal analysis more robust, amongst others by disambiguating causal claims and clarifying or strengthening the existing methodological advice on counterfactual analysis. The article's claims are then illustrated using a concrete example, Haggard and Kaufman's analysis of the Argentinian transition to democracy.

A measure is developed to uncover latent status structures based on such relations among students, demonstrating the existence of complex hierarchical structures among communities. Differentiating between students\u2019 rank (verticality) and embeddedness (horizontality), the analysis reveals orthogonal processes of stratification: A student\u2019s rank is associated with their social role at the school, whereas their embeddedness is linked to traditional markers of stratification, such as race and income.

    "description": "Units of analysis in social research do not respond uniformly to events and interventions. Yet it is not always clear which axes of heterogeneity are most important to consider before data analysis. We use causal forests to nonparametrically uncover heterogeneous treatment effects. We then adapt causal forests and advance causal mediation forests to assess heterogeneous direct and indirect effects. This novel adaptation explores heterogeneity in the causal paths linking a treatment to an outcome through a binary, multinomial, or continuous mediator. Both causal forests and causal mediation forests robustly adjust for high-dimensional confounders, yielding asymptotically normal and n1/2 consistent estimates. We show that forest-based approaches often outperform alternative methods in identifying effect heterogeneity. We apply the forest-based methods to study the heterogeneous effects of four-year college on reducing poverty with data from the National Longitudinal Survey of Youth 1979 and 1997 cohorts and find large gains for disadvantaged youth.",

Comparing areas with high and low program penetration before and after rollback, we find that rollback immediately reduced school enrollment, especially at high school ages and especially in boys. Effects on enrollment were as large at rollback as they were at rollout, albeit shifted from middle-school ages to high school ages. Rising work mirrored falling enrollment in boys of high school age.

Using four waves of longitudinal data on 1,194 mothers collected between March 2022 and October 2023, some captured during periods of food inflation, we find that 1) larger kin support networks offer protection against severe food insecurity for some households, but heighten food insecurity risk for others 2) household SES and network SES feature in reciprocal kin support dynamics that affect the direction of food insecurity outcomes, however 3) larger kin support networks improve children\u2019s dietary diversity, regardless of household and network SES.

    "description": "Recent acts of racial violence, the growing visibility of nationalized white power movements, and a drift toward a number of more restrictive laws and Supreme Court rulings have raised troubling questions about the significance and influence of social acceptance in the United States. Focusing on voters and elections, an important strain of scholarship has argued that declining acceptance of minority groups and marginalized communities contributed to the political rise of Donald Trump and his 2016 election to the presidency. However, the argument that low levels of social acceptance benefited Republican candidates is premised on a basic yet untested assumption: that social acceptance has decreased over the time period covered by the past several elections. In this study, we offer a new and systematic evaluation of this assumption through an analysis of change in the level of social acceptance within the American electorate and its political influence from the 2012 through 2020 elections. The analysis focuses on key target groups that include racial minorities, women, immigrants, and gay and lesbian individuals. We find that voters adopted more supportive and inclusive positions toward these marginalized social groups, resulting in a substantial increase in social acceptance over time. Contrasting further with much of the commentary regarding the rise of Donald Trump, our analysis indicates that these trends in social acceptance served to hurt Trump and to help his Democratic opponents. Supplemental analyses find little evidence that social desirability influences the measures of social acceptance or their estimated influence on voter choice.",

    "description": "This study examines the ethical dimensions of health communication during the 2022 mpox outbreak, focusing on the interplay between social media and public health officials in shaping stakeholder responses. Based on semi-structured interviews, findings reveal that social media played a crucial role in information dissemination for months during the crisis, while public health officials were slow to offer clear guidance. While social media empowers advocacy and the sharing of personal stories, it also raises ethical concerns, particularly regarding how vulnerable communities may become entangled in an economy of suffering, where their experiences of pain are validated and interpreted by stakeholders through a selective mechanism rooted in cultural codes and power dynamics. Moreover, systemic inequities render the suffering of marginalized groups, particularly those with intersecting identities, less visible and intensify the consequences of inadequate outreach. This creates a disparity where the suffering of those in more privileged positions is more readily recognized and addressed. The theoretical advancement lies in reconceptualizing the platformization of pain to include narrative resistance, highlighting that marginalized groups actively contest and reshape suffering narratives rather than passively experience them. This expanded framework also deepens the concept of an economy of suffering by integrating hermeneutical injustice, which emphasizes how power dynamics shape not only the visibility of suffering but also the interpretive frameworks that validate certain narratives while marginalizing others.",

    "description": "The US Fish and Wildlife Service (USFWS) manages over 560 National Wildlife Refuges and dozens of National Fish Hatcheries across the United States. Accurately estimating visitor numbers to these areas is essential for understanding current recreation demand, planning for future use, and ensuring the ongoing protection of the habitats, fish, and wildlife that refuges safeguard. However, accurately estimating visitation across the entire refuge system presents significant challenges. Building on previous research conducted on other federal lands, this study evaluates methods to overcome constraints in estimating visitation levels using statistical models and digital mobility data. We develop and test a visitation modeling approach using multiple linear regression, incorporating predictors from eight mobility data sources, including four social media platforms, one community science platform, and three mobile phone location datasets from two commercial vendors. We find that the number of observed visitors to refuges correlates with the volume of data from each mobility source. However, neither social media nor commercial mobile phone location data alone provide reliable proxies for visitation due to inconsistent relationships with observed visitation; these relationships vary by data source, refuge, and time. Our results demonstrate that a visitation model integrating multiple mobility datasets accounts for this variability and outperforms models based on individual mobility datasets. We find that a refuge-level effect is the single most important predictor, suggesting that including site characteristics in future models will make them more generalizable. We conclude that statistical models which incorporate digital mobility data have the potential to improve the accuracy of visitor estimates, standardize data collection methods, and simplify the estimation process for agency staff.",

    "description": "Employee turnover is a challenge for public sector employers. In this study, we used machine learning to develop and validate models to predict actualized turnover of Finnish public sector workers. The development cohort data (N=52 291) included 158 variables from 2018. We defined overall turnover (regardless of reason) and net turnover (excluding workers in retirement age) through eligibility to a follow-up survey in 2020. The validation cohort included 9030 hospital workers who responded to survey in 2017, with turnover assessed in 2019. Area under the curve (AUC) value was 0.75 (95% CI: 0.74-0.76) for overall turnover and 0.75 (95% CI 0.73-0.76) for net turnover. The validation yielded similar AUC values. Key predictors of turnover were younger age, shorter job tenure, and turnover intentions totaling over 70% of the net gain. Work-related exposures, of which low threat of lay-off and satisfaction with challenges at work were most important, had considerably lower predictive power (about 1% each). These results may offer insights for public sector employers in their efforts to reduce employee turnover.",

    "description": "Equality of opportunity is a principle of social justice, although there are different conceptions of it. We distinguish between fair and luck egalitarian equality of opportunity. Both conceptions consider to be unfair inequalities in life chances resulting from ascribed characteristics such as social origin and sex. They differ, however, in that fair equality of opportunity considers it fair when innate abilities affect life chances. Luck egalitarianism places innate abilities in the category of morally arbitrary factors that do not provide a just basis for inequalities in life chances. Empirically, we use genetic information to measure innate abilities and compare this approach to observing abilities later in life. Using genetic information allows us to better disentangle the role of innate abilities from those of environmental influences and individual choices. We apply this approach to nationally representative data from the German Socio-Economic Panel Study (SOEP). According to our results, luck egalitarian inequality of opportunity is considerably larger than fair inequality of opportunity, especially for education. Measuring innate abilities using genetic information leads to very similar conclusions as using abilities measured later in life, with slightly smaller differences between fair and luck egalitarian inequality of opportunity.",

    "description": "Large local government spending cuts in England, spanning over a decade of austerity politics, have severely restricted the universal services and public goods that shape parenting environments. Drawing on the Reproductive Justice framework, we ask whether restricting the right to parent in safe and healthy environments impinged on the right to have children. To do so, we introduce a new quantitative approach for \u201cthinking with\u201d Reproductive Justice. Using nationally representative UK Household Longitudinal Study (UKHLS) data and a within-between random effects model, we analyse whether local government spending cuts were associated with intersectional inequalities in childbearing over the 2010-2020 period. We find that local government spending cuts significantly decreased the probability of having a(nother) birth for women in the poorest households, by 9.1%, but not for women in the middle or richest households. Further, racially minoritised women across income categories were much more likely to live in local authorities that suffered substantial cuts. Although austerity policies may not have directly restricted people\u2019s biological capacity to conceive, our findings show that local government austerity cuts unequally restricted the right to have children.",

    "description": "Scholars of the legacies of state violence have overwhelmingly focused on families as the vehicle through which repression influences political behavior. However, people exist within multiple social groups, and early socialization literature identified both kin and non-kin groups as important components of political socialization. In this paper, we incorporate this insight and explore the comparative effects of repression of family, friends, and community on subsequent political behavior through an original nationally representative survey of 1,200 adult Tunisians combined with 175 sibling pairs of the primary respondents. Our analyses of the primary sample demonstrate that repression of friends under previous authoritarian regimes is a consistently significant predictor of turnout, vote choice, and protest participation. The effect of the repression of friends remains significant even after controlling for family repression using the paired sibling sample. Similar to other forms of indirect exposure to violence, the effect of having friends who were repressed on political behavior is mediated through talking politics with them. Our findings complicate existing narratives that focus on families as the unit through which state violence matters for politics and suggest scholars have likely missed the full extent to which repression affects political behavior.",

I find that across groups, across communities, and over time, the role of household income in shaping segregation patterns varies widely. White-Black segregation is lowest between high-income households and is declining consistently for all income groups, even at mismatched incomes. White-Latino segregation patterns are more inconsistent, with segregation staying low and stable for high-income Latino households but rising somewhat for low- and middle-income households. Finally, White-Asian segregation is rising and has risen the fastest for high-income Asian households. These findings call for continuing investigation into the shifting and interlocking dynamics of race and income that shape segregation outcomes.",

Results from an original survey vignette experiment (N\u2009=\u20091,200) show respondents are less likely to support government aid to help low-income people pay utility bills when policy frames invoke air conditioning rather than heat. A replication (N\u2009=\u2009703) finds this effect is most pronounced among White respondents.

    "description": "A theory of rational attitude formation suggests public perceptions of income differences as too large should lead to demands for income redistribution. Public opinion scientists irregularly observe this at best. It is possible that the instruments we use to observe support for income redistribution are ineffective. We suggest at least part of the inconsistently observed linkage is due to unobserved confounding of government heuristics. We hypothesize that government affect provides a heuristic cue for survey respondents to answer questions on their government engaging in income redistribution. The greater the valence or quantity of reasons for a survey respondent to feel negatively toward the government, the more perceptions of inequality and support for redistribution are decoupled and apparently inconsistent. To test this, we measured potential sources of government affect at the country-time level as trust, corruption perceptions, and economic performance. We executed tests of moderation using slopes-as-outcomes regressions with ISSP data from 36 countries in 102 country-time points. Given the difficulty in fitting complex theories of society and politics into a limited number of macro-comparative cases, we ran a multiverse of alternatively plausible models. There is a consistent negative moderation effect across models suggesting that or theory of government affect as opinion expression on a survey is worthy of further consideration. The findings also suggest more qualitative cognitive survey interviews to better understand this process.",

Data are readily and openly available, updated in real time, and provide global coverage which makes it ideal for near-real time forecasting. Prediction targets are the number of security-related incidents and battle-related, non-state, and civilian casualties.

Yet, it remains unclear how best to assess and understand genAI's influence on our understanding of social reality. Building on insights into the representation of social worlds within texts, we develop an initial framework for analyzing genAI's content and its consequences for perceptions of social reality. We demonstrate this \"synthetic duality\" framework in two parts. First, we show that genAI can create, with minimal guidance, reasonable portrayals of actors and ascribe relational meaning to those actors \u2013 virtual social worlds within texts, or \"Mondo-Breigers\". Second, we examine how these synthetic documents with interior social worlds affect readers\u2019 view of social reality. We find that they change individuals' perceptions of actors depicted in the documents, likely by updating individuals' expectations about the actors and their meanings. However, additional exploratory analyses suggest it is texts' style, not their construction of \"Mondo-Breigers\", that might be influencing people's perceptions. We end with a discussion of theoretical and methodological implications, including how genAI may unsettle structural notions of individuality. Namely, reimagining the duality of individuals and groups could help theorize growing homogeneity in an increasingly AI-informed world.",

    "description": "Predicting the location of moving objects in noisy environments is essential to everyday behavior, like when participating in traffic. Although many objects provide multisensory information, it remains unknown how humans use multisensory information to localize moving objects, and how this depends on expected sensory interference (e.g., occlusion). In four experiments, we systematically investigated localization performance for auditory, visual, and audiovisual targets. Performance for audiovisual targets was compared to performance predicted by Maximum Likelihood Estimation (MLE). In Experiment 1A, moving targets were occluded by an audiovisual occluder, and their final locations had to be inferred from target speed and occlusion duration. Participants relied exclusively on the visual component of the audiovisual target, even though the auditory component demonstrably provided useful location information when presented in isolation. In contrast, when a visual-only occluder was used in Experiment 1B, participants relied primarily on the auditory component of the audiovisual target, even though the visual component demonstrably provided useful location information when presented in isolation. In Experiment 2, no multisensory precision benefits were found when participants localized moving audiovisual target objects. Yet, localization estimates were in line with MLE predictions. In Experiment 3, a substantial multisensory benefit was found when participants localized static audiovisual target objects, showing near-MLE audiovisual integration. In sum, observers use both hearing and vision when localizing static objects, but use only unisensory input when localizing moving objects and predicting motion under occlusion, perhaps to minimize short-term memory load. Moreover, observers can flexibly prioritize one sense over the other, in anticipation of modality-specific interference.",

    "description": "Although economic inequality and economic segregation represent fundamental challenges of contemporary societies, their causal and empirical connections remain unclear. In particular, the direction of causality, causal pathways, and temporal relationship are not apparent in the literature. This stems from two observations: 1/ the discussion is dominated by a handful of studies from the USA originating from the 2000s. This comes at the expense of a more plural and complex understanding of phenomena in the rest of the world. 2/ the literature on inequality and that of segregation are segmented by disciplines operating at different scales with corresponding theories, actors and mechanisms. To address these issues, I conduct an extensive systematic literature review of articles linking economic inequality to economic segregation across multiple languages and disciplines. Starting from 20,000+ references, I identify 80 research articles. Most conclude that variations in economic segregation follow differences in economic inequality in the short term and that reverse causality is more probable in the longer term. The housing market is the most cited mediator between economic inequality and economic segregation, and a diversity of theories are mobilized to explain their empirical connections. Many articles are not presently comparable, but compatible definitions and measurements of inequality and segregation are rising.",

    "description": "This chapter provides an ethnographic account of how content creators present cancer cures on TikTok. It assesses the quality of cancer cure videos algorithmically recommended by TikTok, the radicalization pathways afforded by short video platforms like TikTok and their potential to cause online harms. Content creators commonly feature contrarian doctors and draw on a conspiratorial worldview to present various miracle cures as intentionally concealed and stigmatized by the establishment. This framing gives credence to creators\u2019 claims and the cures they promote. It also presents TikTok as a more reliable platform from which to access health information censored by the mainstream. Since TikTok is used as a search engine by younger demographics, it becomes a key means of accessing health information. Using TikTok to access health information poses significant risks: First, the technological affordances of TikTok render the app susceptible to radicalizing users. While radicalization is not technologically determined by simply viewing content, radicalization can occur through the endless scroll of conspiratorial content algorithmically recommended to users searching for cancer cures on the platform through a gradual process of socialization. Second, short form videos can become a gateway to radical views because these videos commonly direct users to personal bios, websites and ecommerce stores. Third, radicalization and online harms can be facilitated by TikTok because the app provides accessible avenues for monetization that incentivize content creators to profit from fake cancer cures. This research has important implications for content moderators because the risk of cancer misinformation is not limited to the content uploaded the platform, but the ways in which short videos become a gateway to harmful products and more extreme, conspiratorial content.",

    "description": "The mountain communities of late-first millennium BC Italy have been regarded as non-urban societies that reverted to city life mainly owing to Roman intervention. A growing body of archaeological evidence is uncovering the diversity of settlement forms and dynamics in the region\u2019s pre-Roman past, which included sites encompassing a range of functions and social agents. This article presents an indepth, microscale analysis of one such site, Monte Vairano in Samnium, drawing on perspectives from comparative urbanism. Monte Vairano developed urban characteristics such as a complex socioeconomic profile and political cohesion, as well as potentially more unique features such as an apparently balanced distribution of wealth. These results can shed further light on the diversity of ancient urbanization and its sociopolitical implications in late-first millennium BC Italy and the Mediterranean.",

    "description": "This article builds on research demonstrating that inequality is widely accepted when it results from practices that are perceived to be fair. Using a survey experiment on a nationally representative sample of U.S. adults (n=3,978), the study adds new insight into the mechanisms that sustain gender inequality in relationships. Findings show that Americans\u2019 beliefs about gender are relied on more often than economic explanations to diminish concerns about unfairness in decision making. Respondents were more likely to view decisions as fair when made by women, even though respondents often drew on seemingly gender-neutral allocation rules to justify decision making. Topic modelling of open-ended explanations also exposed how beliefs about gender are incorporated into fairness perceptions in ways that sustain men\u2019s authority. The authors argue that the empirical patterns underpinning subjective perceptions of fairness are fundamental to understanding the persistence of inequality in gendered divisions of cognitive, emotional, and domestic labor.",

    "description": "A fundamental concern in studying social inequalities is understanding how socioeconomic advantages and disadvantages are passed down from generation to generation. However, previous studies have not adequately distinguished between the contributions of genetic and environmental factors to socioeconomic disadvantage. In this paper, we use Finnish register data on twins born from 1975 to 1986, considering a total of 7,628 pairs, to analyze how genetic and environmental factors are associated with dropout from secondary education, unemployment, and the receipt of social assistance during early adulthood. The results of the twin design show that not only environmental but also genetic factors play a role in all measured socioeconomic disadvantage outcomes. For school dropout and, particularly, unemployment, genetic components explain more than shared environment. Conversely, for the receipt of social assistance, the shared environment component is larger than the genetic component. This result indicates that living in impoverished economic conditions is more dependent on factors related to social resources than those related to genetic inheritance. Of all the measured indicators, the unique environment is the most important, indicating the influence of stochastic life events regarding socioeconomically disadvantageous outcomes.",

    "description": "Grizzly bears (Ursus arctos horribilis) were extirpated from central Idaho\u2019s Bitterroot Ecosystem (BE) by 1946. After a failed attempt to reintroduce grizzlies to the BE in the 1990s, individual grizzlies have been documented in the region since 2007, with natural recovery a future potentiality in the region. To proactively inform conservation and management efforts amidst potential natural recovery, an exploratory mixed methods research design used interviews and focus groups to assess BE residents\u2019 opinions on grizzly bear management, tolerance of grizzlies, and trust in agencies to manage grizzlies. Results from thematic analysis reveal: (1) distrust of management agencies and conservation organizations that stems from general perceptions of untrustworthiness and the wolf reintroduction that occurred in central Idaho in the mid-1990s, (2) trust-building preferences, including accessible staff and participatory opportunities, and ways for agencies and organizations to increase perceptions of trustworthiness, (3) intolerance towards management that stems from perceptions of an inequitable constitutive process that excludes BE residents from decision-making, potential threats from Endangered Species Act regulations, and a lack of clarity about current and future management plans, (4) preferred actions to increase tolerance towards management, including a decentralized decision-making process, educational outreach about grizzlies, and a hunting season, (5) intolerance towards grizzlies that stems from safety, economic, and cultural concerns, and (6) tolerance towards grizzlies that stems from appreciation and the belief in their right to exist. Findings suggest improved communication efforts about management intentions and a more equitable constitutive process can address issues of tolerance, trust, social injustice, and the material and non-material costs of grizzly presence in the BE region.",

    "description": "The integration of Large Language Models (LLMs) into various applications as quasi-search engines raises significant concerns about their impact on misinformation and societal decision-making processes. LLMs are designed to generate text that mimics human speech, often detached from factual reality, which poses risks when used unchecked. Developers and corporations advancing LLM technology argue for enhanced effectiveness through increased context window size and computational power. However, this paper challenges this assertion, arguing that augmenting the context window primarily improves the LLMs' ability to generate human-like narratives rather than enhancing their capacity for real-world decision-making. The paper advocates for a paradigm shift where LLMs move beyond merely sounding human to effectively adjudicating real-world challenges, emphasizing the need for ethical and practical advancements in AI development to mitigate the risks associated with misinformation and naive use of LLMs in critical decision-making processes. Finally, the paper proposes alternative approaches and criteria to address identified limitations; including grounded language models, causal reasoning integration, ethical frameworks, hybrid systems, and interactive learning.",

    "description": "This paper investigates the impact of the 1997 Asian financial crisis on Japanese multinational firms' foreign direct investment (FDI) in Korea. The study uses a comprehensive dataset of Japanese firms' foreign affiliates between 1990 and 2018 and analyzes the effects of the crisis and the subsequent reforms, including the removal of foreign ownership restrictions, on FDI stocks and ownership ratios. The paper employs state-of-the-art difference-in-differences (DiD) techniques, contrasting Japanese affiliates in Korea with their siblings in other developed countries. We find that while the crisis significantly increased the multinational ownership ratio of affiliates in Korea, it did not have a significant impact on FDI stocks. This suggests that the crisis and associated reforms were more likely to influence ownership structures than FDI levels and that policy changes can play a crucial role in mitigating the negative effects of financial crises on FDI. The study also finds that the crisis had the largest impact on majority-owned affiliates in the middle range, implying that minority-owned affiliates and wholly-owned affiliates were less affected by the reforms.",

    "description": "This study examines how institutional contexts in 25 European countries moderate the association between family structure and tertiary education attainment. Previous research has proposed the resource deprivation perspective to explain lower educational outcomes among children from disrupted families, suggesting that policies addressing resource deprivation could mitigate these negative consequences. However, limited attention has been given to the role of policy contexts in shaping the educational outcomes of youth from disrupted families. This study focuses on two types of policies: the generosity of social benefits to single parents and financial support for students in tertiary education. Using data from the EU-SILC and employing multilevel regression models, the findings indicate that generous financial support for students reduces the tertiary education attainment gap between youth from separated and two-parent families. However, this effect is observed only among low-socioeconomic status (SES) and moderate-SES families. In contrast, the generosity of social benefits does not appear to moderate the association between family structure and tertiary education attainment, even when examining low-SES families or specifically considering benefits for low-earning single parents. Furthermore, the influence of these analysed policies is limited among young people from widowed families.",

Right-wing authoritarianism emerged as the strongest predictor of resistance to pandemic prevention attitudes and behaviors even when controlling its effect with belief in science, demographics, and risk factors.

We explore the nature and resolution of this dilemma with a formalization that builds on recent work in the political economy of nondemocracy. When the regime is sufficiently repressive, and the dictator's popularity correspondingly unclear to opposition as well as autocrat, the ruler faces two unattractive options: he can mobilize the repressive apparatus, even though there may be no threat to his rule, or he can refrain from mobilizing, even though the danger may be real. Semicompetitive elections can ease the dilemma through the controlled revelation of discontent. Paradoxically, the manipulation of information through such non-repressive means can allow for more rather than less repression.",

    "description": "This study examines the divergent development of the platform-based food delivery sector in Germany, focusing on why the ideal-typical gig economy model based on self-employed couriers has not taken hold. Unlike other countries, Germany stands out as an exceptional case where large food delivery platforms classify their workers as employees, providing them with rights and benefits such as minimum wage, paid vacation, and sick leave. The study uses a historical-sociological case study approach to reconstruct the development of the sector and the decision-making processes that have influenced this development. Drawing on historical institutionalism, the analysis examines different heuristics for divergent paths: self-reinforcing path dependence, self-induced reactive sequences, critical junctures, mindful path creation, and transformative incremental change. The study finds that early market shaping by the pioneering company Bringdienst.de (later called Pizza.de), which focused on equipping restaurants to deliver online orders without taking responsibility for the delivery itself, significantly influenced the market environment. In addition, a court ruling in 2020 has increased the risk perception of bogus self-employment among platforms, leading to the abandonment of the gig worker model with self-employed couriers. The study concludes that the critical juncture heuristic, combined with a shadow of the past effect of market constitution, best explains the unique development in Germany.",

We introduce human behavioral ecology holistically, including its history, methodological frameworks, pet topics, recent integration with related fields, with a special emphasis on its recent integration with Chinese social, archaeological, and life sciences scholarship. We address potential criticisms of human behavioral ecology and how to ensure a robust and careful application of human behavioral ecology principles in the study of human behavior in China, past and present.

    "description": "There is a growing need to maximise the social benefits achieved from public investment in infrastructure, particularly with the transition to net zero economies. Project Delivery Models (PDMs)\u2014the contractual agreements that set out roles and responsibilities for infrastructure project partners\u2014can underpin the delivery of social benefits, yet the processes involving their selection are largely opaque. In this paper we explore how social considerations inform PDM selection and how this is facilitated by policy. We interviewed highly experienced procurement professionals from the sector about how social benefits and risks are considered. We also examined how the associated regulatory environment supports social considerations through documentary analysis of auditing guidance documents. We found that not only are social benefits sidelined in early project decisions, but social risks are inadequately considered. An entrenched gap in social expertise contributes to this situation while project compartmentalisation presents challenges for inclusion and transparency in decision-making. Current auditing processes provide little incentive for social benefit consideration and reinforce both risk framing and compartmentalisation of major infrastructure projects. The paper offers new and important insights into this early project stage and distils five recommendations for improving social benefit creation from infrastructure investments, particularly in developed economies.",

An additional 21 sites have been excavated in 2023, deemed important enough for reconstruction efforts (Yang, 2023). However, while significant research exists on the archeological sites themselves, there is scarcely any public recognition of the soldiers that manned the stations and their subsequent socioeconomic standing. Popular culture has abbreviated depictions of Joseon-dynasty watchtowers to a similar level: (significant for) \u201can extensive communications network to deliver information about enemy forces, that also employed horseback riders as an emergency backup\u201d (Ntl. Institute of Kor. History, 2024). I argue this depiction is overly generic and implies equivalence to Eurocentric watchtower practices, ignoring the cultural nuances that made the position of the average Joseon-dynasty watchman significantly challenging and fundamentally divergent from then-contemporary watchmen in European countries. This paper subsequently attempts to discern and critically evaluate the sociocultural status of soldiers stationed at Joseon watchtowers (Bonghwa), comparing them against European watchtowers and their socioeconomic conditions. Specific sites include Caernarfon Castle and Cheonlim Bonghwa Watchtower at the site of Cheonlim Mountain, the latter of which has been accompanied by more thorough artifact and observational fieldwork analysis. Recovered artifacts include living quarters, barriers, and tools. Further literature analysis was conducted to discern the socioeconomic standing and practices of Bonghwa watchmen in context of mid-century Joseon dynasty caste systems. In combining fieldwork and sociocultural analysis, I develop a multidimensional account of Joseon watchmen and prove that the soldiers assigned to Joseon watchtowers, Bonghwa, are representative of an underrepresented social dynamic, as well as providing insights into the philosophical and theological differences between the Western sphere through material conditions.",

Compared to youth with no history of suspension, suspended youth were more likely to report poorer health in adolescence. Findings also demonstrate that school suspension plays a significant role in self-rated health patterns over time. Specifically, we find suspended youth experience a persistent health gap in excellent health from adolescence to midlife and a more rapid acceleration of fair and poor health from their late 20s to midlife.

    "description": "Stereotypes are foundational to social life, with warmth and competence key to views of social groups. Some theoretical and empirical work on stereotypes focuses on personal \u201cfirst-order\u201d beliefs about social groups. Other work focuses on perceptions of a culture\u2019s stereotypes, or \u201cgeneralized second-order\u201d beliefs. Scholars differ in which they consider to have greater impact or whether they think they are unique or represent the same underlying belief. In this visualization, I present data from a large online survey experiment (N\u2009=\u20091,045) in which participants reported either first-order or generalized second-order stereotypes about 19 different social groups. For the majority of stereotypes measured, the results differ across the two methods, with perceptions of culture more pessimistic than people\u2019s actual first-order beliefs would suggest. That is, people tend to assume that others hold more negative stereotypes than they actually do, and this is especially pronounced for negatively viewed social groups.",

    "link": "https://share.osf.io/preprint/E01B9-E5F-E93",
    "description": "Exposure to environmental burdens, such air and noise pollution or the lack of available green spaces, has been linked to a multitude of detrimental outcomes. Previous evidence indicates that poor residents and foreign minorities in European cities are disproportionately exposed to environmental burdens. However, there are substantial but ill-understood differences between European countries and between cities within countries. To address this limitation, we utilise fine-grained 1km-by-1km neighbourhood grid data on objective air and noise pollution as well as green space availability, enriched with administrative data on poverty rates and foreign minority shares from all German cities with at least 100,000 inhabitants in 2017. We examine whether poor residents and foreign minorities are more often affected by environmental burdens, how their exposure to environmental burdens differs between cities, and what city-specific contextual factors contribute to these between-city differences. We find evidence that foreign minorities are more likely to be exposed to environmental burdens, but poor residents are predominantly not. However, there is considerable variation between cities. The strongest explanatory factor for this variation is the extent to which disadvantaged groups live in central neighbourhoods, less so residential segregation of poor and foreign residents, or the scarcity of \u2018clean and healthy\u2019 neighbourhoods in a city. Against these results, we further explore empirically how the current wave of inner-city gentrification might ease environmental inequality in German cities.",

    "description": "Citizens are expected to hold corrupt politicians accountable. However, while observational studies and field experiments often find corrupt politicians re-elected, survey experiments show that citizens are unlikely to vote for corrupt candidates. This contradiction may arise because previous studies have not accounted for how citizens navigate political information in the real world. In this paper, we propose a model of corruption accountability that considers how citizens selectively engage with political information. We test this model using a PICA experimental design fielded in Spain. The results indicate that information selection can explain the limited consequences of corruption scandals, as not all citizens expose themselves to corruption information, and their likelihood to hold corrupt politicians accountable depends on their information preferences. These findings suggest corruption accountability may be increased not by informing those who select out of counter-attitudinal information, but by reaching inattentive citizens generally not exposed to political information.",

    "description": "Illegal dumping, the unauthorized disposal of waste in public spaces, poses significant environmental, social, and economic challenges, particularly in Ontario, Canada. This study investigates the drivers behind illegal dumping, with a focus on rural and urban communities in Ontario. Using a mixed-methods approach, including household surveys and interviews, we examine self-reported instances of dumping, attitudes towards waste management, and perceived barriers to legal waste disposal. The results reveal that inadequate waste collection infrastructure, particularly in rural areas, and high disposal costs are primary motivators for illegal dumping. Additionally, a lack of awareness regarding proper disposal methods exacerbates the issue. While most respondents recognize the immorality of illegal dumping, rural participants show less guilt and are more likely to engage in the behavior. The study provides actionable insights for policymakers, including the need for improved waste infrastructure, targeted educational campaigns, and increased enforcement efforts. By addressing these key factors, Ontario can mitigate the environmental and public health risks posed by illegal dumping, while fostering a culture of responsible waste disposal.",

In the same period, a separate research line has focused on political polarization and the strengthening of radical right parties in many countries. This study brings these two lines together by asking how public opinion in deeply polarized countries responds to violent international conflicts, which, under lesser polarization, would have likely led most citizens to close ranks behind the government and its war policy. To answer this question, we analyzed original panel data collected in Israel before and after the October 7 massacre and during Israel\u2019s retaliation in Gaza. The findings reveal mixed patterns that we label \u201csegmented rally:\u201d The vast majority supported the war and trusted the security forces, but only a minority trusted the government and the prime minister. The analysis identified distinct sets of mechanisms of opinion formation. Rallying behind the war and security forces was motivated by feelings of threat, humiliation, and rage. In contrast, trust or mistrust of the government and the PM depended on whether respondents blamed the government or anti-government protests for the security crisis, an assessment driven by respondents\u2019 preexisting views about the government\u2019s \u201cjudicial reform\u201d initiative.

    "description": "In today\u2019s world of information overload, people need skills to quickly and critically evaluate online content; they must be able to consider the credibility and quality of information as well as recognize fake and misleading information. Here, we operationalize critical thinking skills into 6 measurable concepts (i.e., causation and correlation, independent data and replicates, reproducibility, credibility of sources, experimental control, and significance), and we explore whether teaching these 6 concepts enhances scientific literacy and/or resilience against fakeness (fake tweets) and misinformation. Mixed results from our study reveal that: 1) in a small group game on misinformation, critical thinking training significantly improves accuracy and speed in assessing the truthfulness of scientific information online; 2) in a large, preregistered, randomized trial, understanding and application of critical thinking skills concepts strongly correlates with participants\u2019 ability to identify fake tweets and misinformation; however, critical thinking training with recorded videos does not enhance participants\u2019 proficiency in detecting fakeness and misinformation. There is a need to develop innovative interventions to prepare people to respond to misinformation, which is fast-evolving. Tools to support misinformation-specific critical thinking skills have been largely unexplored, and we anticipate such tools might be a valuable contribution to help the public navigate infodemics.",

I illustrate the usefulness of this concept by applying it to oil and conflict. By leveraging the records of over 600,000 wildcat drills, natural experiments, and difference-in-differences, I demonstrate that fuel resources increase interstate conflicts only when they are discovered in areas claimable to multiple states. The extensive analyses of validity, heterogeneity, and mechanisms, as well as a \u201cmost-similar\u201d case study, provide further credence. These findings imply a crucial role of claimability; states claim and dispute only when international norms permit such actions.",

This intergenerational persistence of child mortality existed independently from socioeconomic differences in child mortality. Inequalities accumulated, as child mortality was highest for low-SES children whose parents originated from high-mortality, low-socioeconomic status families. Intergenerational transmission in child mortality persisted even when child mortality had declined in the early 20th century.",

    "description": "Autoethnography is a methodological approach which seeks to provide depth of experience and understanding of a phenomena through the researcher\u2019s analysis of their own personal experience. As a veterinary researcher with a focus on different methodologies, I elected to apply the autoethnographic approach to my experiences adopting my cat, Athena, from a shelter in 2014. I knew I had experienced feelings of regret and considered relinquishing Athena in the immediate post-adoption period, and I was interested in using this as a case study into the formation of a successful human companion-animal relationship. Through my analysis of my own experiences, I have three main reflections which may be able to aid the veterinary and shelter industries in supporting successful adoptions. First, the highly individual nature of each individual companion animal relationship must be recognised and supported, with veterinary and shelter advice being tailored to the specific needs of the owner and animal. Second, the transition to pet owner requires more active and realistic management, without following a \u2018recipe\u2019 for a perfect owner and pet relationship. Finally, I reflect on how my own mental health impacted the process of adoption in light of research surrounding the beneficial impacts of companion animals on pets. Overall, I found the autoethnographic process to be a challenging, but useful lens onto the phenomenon of pet relinquishment, and highlight some considerations for its use in veterinary research.",

Specifically, we focus on the choice of whether to target an estimand that includes indirect comparisons between two features in addition to direct comparisons. We show that although this permits researchers to incorporate more observed tasks in estimation, it can also raise problems of interpretability when indirect and direct comparisons diverge in sign and magnitude. We develop a novel set of statistical tools, which integrate easily with existing workflows, to guide practitioners in choosing the estimand that best suits their needs.",

This article explains the pretrain-finetune paradigm for transformer-based language models and its potential to improve text analysis in political science by harnessing robust models trained on extensive datasets while requiring relatively small amounts of labeled data and computational resources from researchers. To demonstrate its effectiveness, I employ the approach to identify toxic language in conversation threads following US Senators' tweets.",

    "description": "Scholars and university administrators have a vested interest in building equitable valuation systems of academic work for both practical (e.g., resource distribution) and more lofty purposes (e.g., what constitutes \u201cgood\u201d research). Well-established inequalities in science pose a difficult challenge to those interested in constructing a parsimonious and fair method for valuation as stratification occurs within academic disciplines, but also between them. The h-index, a popular research metric, has been formally used as one such method of valuation. In this article, we use the case of the h-index to examine how the distribution of research metrics reveal within and between discipline inequalities. Using bibliometric data from 1960-2019 on over 50,000 high performing scientists - the top 2% most frequently cited authors - across 174 disciplines, we construct random effects within-between models predicting the h-index. Results suggest significant within-discipline variation in several forms, specifically sole-authorship and female penalties. Results also show that a sole authorship penalty plays a significant role in well-known between-discipline variation. Field-specific models emphasize the \u201capples-to-oranges,\u201d or incommensurable, property of cross-discipline comparison with significant heterogeneity in sole-authorship and female penalties within fields. Conclusions include continued caution when using the h-index or similar metrics for valuation purposes.",

    "description": "Historical narratives and the \"model minority\" myth have obscured the realities of anti-Asian racism in the United States. The escalation of prejudice and hate crimes against Asian Americans during the COVID-19 pandemic further underscored the need for robust measures to quantify this phenomenon. This study proposes a novel county-level index specifically designed to capture the multifaceted nature of anti-Asian racism. The index integrates a diverse data set including geotagged Twitter data assessing public attitudes and potential hate speech directed toward Asian Americans, anti-Asian hate crime records from the Federal Bureau of Investigation\u2019s Uniform Crime Reporting System, Google Search Trends data about anti-Asian stereotypes and narratives, and alien land bills denoting context for discriminatory policies against Asian immigrants at the state level. We employed Principal Component Analysis to combine these data sources into a single, composite index. A validation of the index using nationally representative survey data indicates that two of the three identified principal components significantly predict area racism against Asian respondents. This study offers a nuanced understanding of anti-Asian racism and has the potential to inform targeted interventions, the allocation of resources for community support and educational initiatives, and can be instrumental for policymakers in identifying areas with heightened anti-Asian bias. Additionally, the index serves as a foundation for future research, facilitating the exploration of correlations between anti-Asian racism and various health and social outcomes. While limitations exist regarding data subjectivity and availability, this index represents a significant advancement in measuring anti-Asian racism at the county level. It paves the way for a more comprehensive understanding of this critical issue and the development of effective strategies to combat racial injustice and address related geographic disparities.",

Notably, however, because pre-GI Bill Black-White inequalities in housing outcomes were significant, the policy exacerbated existing racial inequalities. These inequalities have only persisted and intensified into the contemporary period. Finally, I analyze counterfactual scenarios to interrogate how different factors contributed to these racial inequalities.

    "description": "Despite ongoing debates on environmental justice, the link between selective residential migration and the unequal exposure to environmental hazards remains underexplored. Previous research has often relied on spatially aggregated data and focused on single-country analyses, limiting our understanding of broader patterns. We address this gap using longitudinal household-level data from the UK Household Longitudinal Study and the German Socio-Economic Panel linked to air pollution estimates (NO2, PM2.5, and SO2). We find that immigrant minorities are exposed to higher levels of air pollution at their place of residence. The overall disadvantage faced by immigrant minorities in England is three times as large as in Germany. Given that immigrant households start under initially higher levels of air pollution, one would expect convergence with non-immigrant populations over time due to residential moves. However, immigrants face a substantial penalty when moving. If native households started in similar neighbourhoods as immigrants -- the relevant counterfactual -- they would experience higher gains from relocation. Socio-economic factors cannot explain these differences. The pattern holds in both England and Germany, although inequalities in residential mobility are more pronounced in England. In particular, racial and ethnic minorities, such as Bangladeshi, Caribbean and African migrants in England and Turkish migrants in Germany, experience the largest environmental disadvantages.",

The results indicate that citizens do not differ in their attention to different candidate information according to candidate gender. Additionally, respondents' own gender does not make a difference in their attention to masculine and feminine-stereotyped information for women or men candidates.

This experience illustrates the potential for the Apprentice Instructor Model to scale active learning pedagogies to high enrollment courses while simultaneously providing novice instructors critical experience in using active learning early in their teaching.",

    "link": "https://share.osf.io/preprint/E019F-6C8-D15",
    "description": "Recent economic development policy in the United States has, in a break from previous decades, identified equity as an explicit goal. However, little is known about what novel challenges and opportunities face economic development programs and practitioners in attempting to advance equity. This paper reports results from a workshop engaging 48 managers and staff working on components of the Georgia Artificial Intelligence Manufacturing Project (Georgia AIM), a $65 million equity-focused regional economic development project funded by the U.S. Economic Development Administration and the Georgia state government. Participants discussed their understandings of economic participation and equity, potential obstacles and opportunities in achieving equity, and approaches to assessing equity outcomes. Results reveal diversity in understandings of equity in the manufacturing economy. Participants agree that widespread participation in manufacturing work partly constitutes manufacturing equity, but they exhibit more divergence about social, psychological, or environmental aspects of participation and equity. Meanwhile, participants identified a wide variety of both internal and external factors which will affect whether Georgia AIM achieves its equity goals. This report illustrates several tensions which equity-focused economic development projects will have to face\u2014between promoting all or only some sorts of manufacturing jobs; between promoting benefits from manufacturing and reducing harms from manufacturing; and between achieving and assessing impact. Participants\u2019 grounded perspectives on negotiating these tensions can provide guidance for future economic development projects.",

    "link": "https://share.osf.io/preprint/E01F1-327-CDC",
    "description": "Background: In 2022, a nationally representative longitudinal survey in the USA found concerningly high prevalences of support for and personal willingness to engage in political violence, but those prevalences decreased in 2023. This study examines changes in those prevalences from 2023 to 2024, an election year in the USA. Methods: Participants were members of Ipsos KnowledgePanel. Wave 3 of the survey was conducted May 23-June 14, 2024; invitations to participate were sent to all respondents to prior waves who remained in KnowledgePanel. Outcomes are expressed as weighted proportions. Year-to-year change is based on the means of aggregated individual change scores, which have a potential range from 0 (no change) to \u00b12. Results: The 2024 completion rates were 88.4% (8896 respondents/10,064 invitees) overall, 91.6% (8185 respondents/8932 invitees) for invitees in 2024 who had responded in 2023, and 62.8% (711 respondents/1132 invitees) for invitees in 2024 who had responded in 2022 but not in 2023. After weighting, 50.9% (95% confidence interval (CI) 49.5%, 52.3%) were female; weighted mean (SD) age was 48.5 (24.9) years. From 2023 to 2024, the prevalence of the view that violence was usually or always justified to advance at least 1 political objective did not change (2024: 26.2%, 95% CI 25.0%, 27.5%; 2023: 25.3%, 95% CI 24.1%, 26.5%). There were no changes from 2023 to 2024 in willingness to damage property, threaten a person, injure a person, or kill a person in an act of political violence, and no changes in expectations of firearm use in situations where respondents considered political violence justifiable. Changes on other measures were infrequent (17 of 58 comparisons in the main analysis) and small where they occurred (with 2 exceptions, change < 0.05). Conclusions: Contrary to expectation, support for and willingness to participate in political violence in this cohort showed little to no change from 2023 to 2024, an election year in the USA. These findings can help guide prevention efforts.",

The study suggests that the Norse mythology in the video game Skyrim does not directly correlate with contemporary social conflicts. Instead, it suggests that socially relevant themes and ideologies may be attracted to different channels, such as less specific spaces. This aligns with the echo chamber model, where different themes correspond to different communicative and performative spaces. The Norse mythology serves as an open narrative infrastructure for the game's designers and players, supporting the construction of the possible world of the lore. However, the study does not show direct contamination effects on communities, suggesting that the lore may indirectly produce ideology on socially relevant issues.",

    "description": "Narrative engagement offers substantial psychosocial benefits, including cognitive health, emotional and social well-being, and longevity. However, vision loss in older adults can pose challenges in accessing printed narratives. As individuals may shift from print to auditory narratives due to age-related vision loss, understanding how this transition affects narrative engagement becomes crucial. The current work provides a synthesis of the intersection of aging, vision loss, and narrative engagement, focusing on cognitive, emotional, and sensory changes. We discuss how age and vision loss may modify critical components of story engagement, potentially altering narrative consumption and experience. Our research highlights the need to adapt research methodologies and measurement scales to suit older adults and auditory narratives, ensuring they capture unique aspects of auditory engagement and account for sensory impairments. We propose novel directions for studying narrative engagement and offer insights for future research to provide inclusive and accessible narrative forms that support the cognitive and emotional well-being of older adults.",

    "description": "Children from well-resourced families achieve, on average, higher grades and gain more qualifications than those from under-resourced families. Mothers' speech is likely a key driver of the transmission of family background inequality in education. Yet, long-term associations between mothers' speech and children's education-related outcomes beyond the early years have not been studied previously. Here, we quantified differences in mothers' vocabulary sophistication, lexical diversity, and grammatical complexity from 10-minute-long naturalistic speech samples audio-recorded when children were age 5 and starting formal education. Children completed measures of cognition at age 5 and measures of literacy at ages 7 and 10 years; teachers rated their educational achievement at ages 7, 10, and 12 years. Data came from E-Risk, a UK cohort study that recruited families with twins born in 1994 and 1995 who represented the full range of Britain's socioeconomic conditions (analytic sample N = 894 mother-child trios). Mothers' vocabulary sophistication significantly predicted children's cognition, literacy, and educational achievement between the ages of 5 and 12 years, accounting for 2% to 5% of the variance. These estimates were reduced to 1% and 2% or became altogether non-significant after adjusting for mothers' educational attainment and household income. Our findings suggest that mothers' speech plays a small independent role in the long-term transmission of family background inequality in education.",

    "description": "Research on the impact of elections on attitudes toward democracy has focused primarily on satisfaction with democracy. Building on this, we analyze how win- ning and losing elections, along with affective polarization, shapes citizens\u2019 support for norms of democratic restraint and consent. We propose that partisan animus weakens the \u201creservoir of goodwill\u201d that helps citizens accept democratic norms of restraint and consent that may go against their self-interest. However, a compara- tive study of 36 elections and two quasi-experimental case studies show that win- ners and losers do not differ significantly in their support for these key democratic norms. Even in highly polarized contexts, winners\u2019 restraint and losers\u2019 consent remain relatively robust. While satisfaction with democracy is shaped by winner- loser dynamics, especially when polarization is high, support for core democratic principles is not, despite increased partisan hostility.

This study critically examines disparities among prominent climate performance indices, including the Environmental Performance Index (EPI), Climate Change Performance Index (CCPI), and Climate Action Tracker (CAT). We reveal significant divergences in country rankings, particularly between \u2018developed\u2019 and \u2018least developed\u2019 nations, underscoring how methodological choices profoundly impact outcomes and interpretability. We develop an analytic tool, called EPI-equity, to demonstrate how integrating equity principles can substantially alter performance assessments.

Our results suggest that the outcomes of environmental performance indices are more likely to concur when they represent similar perspectives. We propose that explicitly articulating the perspective implied by the formalism of performance indices can enhance transparency, guide developers in aligning methodological choices with intended interpretations, and equip users with a clearer understanding of the results. Our analysis highlights the importance of employing multiple indices that encompass a range of perspectives for a comprehensive evaluation of countries' environmental performance. Our adaptable framework provides a structured approach to guide the selection of indices ensuring that they span a broad spectrum of viewpoints. This method mitigates the likelihood of conflicts arising from fragmented worldviews on complex socio-environmental issues.",

    "description": "Given the global displacement crisis, the integration of refugees has emerged as a critical policy issue for many host countries. A key challenge involves supporting refugees in learning the language of their host country. While several European nations have instituted publicly funded language training for asylum seekers and refugees soon after their arrival, evidence on the efficacy of these early language programs in promoting economic integration remains limited. This study examines the impact of a pioneering, large-scale ad hoc program introduced by German policymakers, which provided basic language training to over 230,000 refugees arriving in 2015-16. Utilizing register data on the population of asylum seekers and exploiting a cutoff date in program eligibility, we assess the program's effectiveness using a regression discontinuity design. Our findings reveal no discernible effect on refugee employment over the subsequent two years. To explore whether language programs are generally ineffective during refugee crises, we contrast these results with the impacts of a more comprehensive, preexisting, yet smaller-scale program. Using a variety of difference-in-differences estimators, we find that this program considerably increased refugee employment. These contrasting findings offer important insights for policymakers on designing effective language training programs for refugees.",

The research, \u2018The role of housing providers in supporting clients with complex needs\u2019, was undertaken for AHURI by researchers from the University of New South Wales, Swinburne University of Technology and the University of Tasmania. It investigates the current challenges in providing social housing to people with complex support needs and considers potential alternative policy responses. Mental health was identified at the centre of many clients\u2019 health needs. Longer social housing wait times and uncertain or unsafe housing was seen as increasing mental health challenges for clients. An increasingly uncertain and expensive rental market was also recognised as exacerbating the issues. At the simplest service response, connecting people to secure housing helped their mental health. Indeed, social housing providers may be the first and only point of contact that clients with unmet mental health needs have with the service system. Developing the housing service providers\u2019 workforce could improve the effectiveness of support provided to people with multiple support needs, together with providing individual casework support for with clients to helping people navigate support networks, including ensuring that clients are designated as priority clients on social housing registries.

    "description": "Background: Social media platforms like TikTok are pivotal for mental health communication (MHC), providing accessible, trusted content. Despite known benefits of creator training programs in improving content quality, it's uncertain if or how these enhancements affect people who watch that content. This study examines how training programs for TikTok creators influence TikTok users\u2019 mental health knowledge construction and intended behaviors by analyzing user comments on TikTok videos. Method: We employed LLM-assisted content analysis to annotate TikTok video comments for mental health knowledge construction and behavioral intentions. We then analyzed the impact of a creator training program on users' mental health knowledge construction through within-subject field experiments. Additionally, we extended this method to measure how TikTok's Mental Health Awareness Month (MHAM) in May 2023 affected user mental health knowledge construction and behavioral intentions. Results: LLM-assisted analysis showed that asynchronous toolkits significantly enhance mental health knowledge construction among video commenters, particularly among creators with high engagement, fewer followers, who are licensed mental health professionals, or who do not offer paid coaching services. MHAM increased mental health knowledge construction among users, though the audiences of the 7 institutions and 10 content creators that were spotlighted by TikTok during MHAM did not show this effect. Conclusions: Asynchronous toolkits improve mental health knowledge construction among video viewers. Future training should focus on emerging creators and separate toolkit learning from conference training to enhance training efficacy. In addition, promoting hashtags such as #MentalHealthAwareness can drive meaningful discussions and knowledge construction in video comments, but there is an opportunity for platforms to refine their creator selection criteria to improve on-platform mental health knowledge construction.",

    "link": "https://share.osf.io/preprint/E009B-6C8-756",
    "description": "Background: The conventional formula for calculating food self-sufficiency cannot cover all the food we eat on a daily basis, and the food self-sufficiency ratio (FSSR) of each country cannot be calculated. The conventional food self-sufficiency ratio (CFSSR) can only calculate the FSSRs of each country for grains. To determine the actual state of food insecurity worldwide as accurately as possible, a method for calculating the FSSR of each country for all the foods we eat on a daily basis is needed. To address this situation, this study proposes the supply-side food self-sufficiency ratio (SSFSSR), which can be used to systematically calculate the self-sufficiency ratio of all foods in all countries/regions. Results: We compared the results of both calculations under the same conditions and used the same data to determine whether the CFSSR or the SSFSSR is a more suitable method for obtaining basic information and formulating measures of global food security. The results showed that the SSFSSR has advantages and practicality over the CFSSR. The SSFSSR can calculate self-sufficiency ratios for all foods in all countries/regions of the world, and the figures for various statistical tests are better. The food that is the subject of the calculation in the SSFSSR formula is the entire supply from production, distribution, storage, and consumption, excluding duplication in the calculation, and includes primary products required to produce secondary products, such as livestock products and edible oils. The study also highlighted the value of reducing the amount of primary products used to produce secondary products such as livestock and edible oils, thereby lowering the primary product conversion rate (PPCR). Conclusion: This study used actual data to estimate the SSFSSR for each country/region to demonstrate the applicability of this method and that lowering the PPCR would lead to an increase in the food self-sufficiency ratio. To further refine this methodology, we find that the most important tasks for the future are to collect more reliable data on calories per weight for a large number of foods, expand the number of types covered by more reliable PPCRs, and analyze those data.",

There is now a new evolutionary worker that goes against social norms by travelling around the world while working remotely, the Digital Nomad. Therefore, this article aims to incorporate Digital Nomads into workplace surveillance research. This resulted in the research question \u201cHow does the Digital Nomad lifestyle interact with workplace surveillance and resistance acts\u201d. To answer this, 5 semi-structured interviews were conducted on Digital Nomads recruited from social media platforms. Interview transcripts were analysed using thematic data analysis where 3 main themes were identified: Shift from Traditional Restraints, Perks of Elite Workers, Panopticon\u2019s Future. Overall, Digital Nomads did not experience intensive surveillance and findings supported the idea that they are productive, elite workers, opting to work for employers that do not monitor their employees. It was also found that Digital Nomads take part in minor acts of resistance, but they were not actively resisting their employers. These results suggest the need for future researchers to further expand upon the status of the Digital Nomad worker and explore their experiences of workplace surveillance and resistance.",

    "description": "Purpose: This study examines whether kindergarten-level Urdu phonological processing predicts the future Grade 1 English word and non-word reading accuracy skills of Urdu-English bilinguals in (i) Pakistan, with an Urdu as a national/societal-language country context, and (ii) Canada, with an Urdu as a heritage-language country context. Method: At Timepoint 1 of this longitudinal study, we assessed 154 Urdu-English kindergarten-aged bilinguals in Pakistan (n = 104) and Canada (n = 50) on their Urdu phonological awareness and rapid automatized naming (RAN) skills, via the Urdu Phonological Tele-Assessment Tool (U-PASS). After 1 year at Timepoint 2, we tested their English word and non-word reading accuracy skills at the Grade 1 level. Result: Our hierarchical linear regressions consistently demonstrated cross-language transfer between Urdu phonological awareness and the English word and non-word reading accuracy measures in both Pakistan and Canada. Predictive strength differences were demonstrated between RAN and reading outcomes, based on country-specific contexts. Conclusion: Our findings demonstrate that languages learnt in both a societal or heritage context (i.e., Urdu) contribute to early reading skills in another language (i.e., English), thereby emphasizing the importance of overall cross-language knowledge at the early stages of learning to read. This study also emphasizes the role of cross-language transfer for facilitating equitable access to early assessment for bilingual populations: Urdu phonological processing skills can be used to identify bilingual children\u2019s future English reading abilities, rather than waiting until the child demonstrates adequate English language proficiency for completing traditional English phonological processing assessments.",

    "description": "This article investigates perceptions of university quality and status threat among White and non-White Democrats and Republicans in response to a curriculum emphasizing diversity. We hypothesize that Americans in general will perceive a university with a diversity-focused curriculum as low quality and that White Americans (particularly Republicans) will perceive the university as posing a status threat. We test our hypotheses with data from a survey experiment of roughly 700 Americans. White Republicans rated a university with a diversity-focused curriculum as low quality; contrary to expectations, White Democrats did not. We find partial support for our predictions regarding status threat, with Republicans indicating more status threat than Democrats. Participants, regardless of political affiliation or race, generally opposed government regulation of university curricula. Findings demonstrate a complex interplay between party affiliation, race, and perceptions of university quality, offering insight for institutions aiming to navigate the challenging environment of diversity-focused education.",

Using multiple binary logistic regression, the authors analyze the 2018 Nigeria Demographic and Health Survey among married women (15\u201349 years of age). The authors define ICW as nulliparous women who have never used contraception and have never experienced pregnancy termination, while NCW are the comparison group.

    "description": "Using regeneration as an interdisciplinary and multilevel theoretical framework and thematic analysis of online news media, we have investigated tourism developments in Ukraine during the first year following Russia\u2019s full-scale military invasion in February 2022. Adopting a regeneration perspective allowed us to discern the mechanisms through which tourism, as a complex system resembling living systems in nature, endures, recovers from war damage, and contributes to the overall recovery of a war-affected country. Our findings indicate that despite the severe damages of war, the country\u2019s tourism system persists, albeit with altered structures and functions, playing a significant role in humanitarian efforts, rehabilitation, community building, in addition to its recreational function. Notably, small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) emerge as key actors in the regeneration process, demonstrating resourcefulness and resilience by recognising changing societal needs and rethinking their own potential to meet those needs. Our research expands the limited knowledge base on tourism developments in a wartime context and contributes to a better understanding of broader regeneration processes in tourism and regenerative tourism.",

Therefore, it becomes important to understand the driving forces of cultural evolution in this environment. In this paper, we present an agent-based model to capture cultural transmission dynamics online, considering characteristics of digital online environments (low-cost production, high-fidelity transmission, high individual reach) that set them apart from offline scenarios. As a case study, we report preliminary findings of a rise in clickbait style in titles across online platforms, and use our model to explain which mechanisms could give rise to this pattern. Generally, the model serves to formulate predictions against which to compare observational data and we show how online trends can be interpreted in terms of cultural evolution. This work outlines an interdisciplinary research agenda for studying and understanding cultural evolution online, with possible implications for regulating online content and designing digital environments.",

    "description": "The transition from fossil fuels to renewable energy presents a major challenge, with green taxes often seen as an efficient policy to promote environmentally friendly behavior. However, these taxes are difficult to implement due to public concerns about immediate costs versus future environmental benefits. To address this, we conducted a survey experiment in Switzerland to investigate whether information on green tax efficacy, compensation through revenue recycling, and party cues can make green taxes more attractive to citizens. Our findings indicate that information about compensation mechanisms and party cues can enhance support for green taxes. In contrast, single instances of information on tax efficacy do not significantly affect beliefs or policy support. Green tax proposals are more popular when compensation strategies address climate change or mitigate social risks and when there is broad party consensus providing clear cues to citizens. However, our findings also underscore the potential trade-off associated with a broad coalition of parties supporting green tax reform, which may lead to diminished support from the left. These insights have important implications for designing and communicating green taxes, highlighting the role of informed beliefs and political signals in shaping public attitudes toward environmental policies.",

    "description": "This article focuses on the strengths and weaknesses of topic modeling for the social studies of science. For about a decade, Natural Language Processing opened new research avenues beyond traditional bibliometric approaches, such as co-citation, co-authorship, and co-word analysis. Among these, the most prevalent are Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) and BERTopic. The first is a Bayesian probabilistic model and the latter is rooted in deep learning. It remains unclear what those differences imply in practice, and how they contribute to our sociological understanding of the inner works of science. This paper compares results obtained by LDA and BERTopic applied to the same dataset composed of all scientific articles (n=34,797) authored by all biology professors in Switzerland between 2008 and 2020. Although they differ in their operationalization, LDA and BERTopic produce topic spaces with a similar global configuration. However, major differences are observed when focusing on specific multidimensional concepts, such as gene or species. Overall, we stress that topic modeling offers a highly valuable ground for collaborative interdisciplinary research among scholars from all the social studies of science and beyond, when combined with in-depth knowledge of the object under scrutiny.",

    "description": "This paper contributes to the existing literature on the effects of unemployment on subjective well-being (SWB) by partnership status. We argue that material and latent deprivation can explain effects of becoming and remaining unemployed on SWB by partnership status, as both partners and their employment status crucially shape the extent of deprivation. To test our hypothesis about partnership-specific unemployment effects on SWB and the mediating roles of latent deprivation (in terms of status loss) and of material deprivation, we use fourteen waves of German panel data. To identify time-varying unemployment effects, we rely on time-distributed fixed effects models. Our results suggest a strong negative and rather time-constant impact of unemployment on SWB, buffered over time for those with working or non-working partners. Further, our results indicate in particular material, but also latent deprivation to be relevant mechanisms for explaining partnership-specific trajectories in the loss of SWB.",

Accurately assessing both possibilities requires panel data collected at relatively short intervals. In this study, I leverage intensive panel data from the Relationship Dynamics and Social Life Study to assess the case of young women\u2019s premarital sexual attitudes and behavior. Through a series of descriptive analyses and cross-lagged panel models, I show that opposition to premarital sex in young adulthood is only sometimes associated with subsequent sexual behavior and that premarital sex is negatively associated with later opposition to premarital sex. Young women are especially likely to reduce their opposition following first sex relative to sex reported at any time. Thus, initial behavioral experiences may result in outsized shocks to attitudes, following an active updating model. That subsequent sex is associated with less attitudinal change suggests that young women initially update their attitudes before settling into them. This study nuances long-standing debates on the malleability of attitudes within a person over time and with respect to behavior and has implications for how people approach behavior according to their attitudes across a wide spectrum of social phenomena.",

Rosenfeld\nSociological Science October 7, 2024\n10.15195/v11.a34\n\n\n\n\n\nU.S. Merit Systems Protection Board (USMSPB) surveys document a decline of more than 50 percent between 1987 and 2016 in the percentage of women working for the federal government who have been sexually harassed (narrowly or broadly defined) in the prior two years. This decline has been underappreciated due to the infrequency of USMSPB surveys and the delayed release of the USMSPB report based on the 2016 survey. The decline in workplace sexual harassment of women has taken place across all federal agencies and at all workplace gender balances. While, in 1987, there was a strong positive correlation between male predominance in the workplace and women&#8217;s report of sexual harassment, this association was greatly diminished by 2016. The formerly substantial gender divide in attitudes toward sexual harassment was also mostly diminished by 2016. By extrapolating the USMSPB surveys of federal workers to the entire U.S. workforce, I estimate that 4.8 million U.S. women were harassed at work in 2016 (using a narrow definition of harassment) and 7.6 million U.S. women were harassed at work in 1987 when the female workforce was substantially smaller. More than 700 women were sexually harassed at work in the United States in 2016 for every sexual harassment complaint filed with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission. The observed decline in sexual harassment has implications for theories about law and social change.",

Whenever a researcher adds a level-1 predictor to the model, the level-2 variance may increase. This is because the level-2 variance also depends on the level-1 variance. The problem is more pronounced when there are few observations per cluster. We present a solution that allows researchers to decompose variance components from the null models into parts explained and unexplained by level-1 predictors. We also offer an extension that incorporates level-2 predictors. Our approach is based on multivariate multilevel modeling and provides a complete decomposition of the gross or null model variance components.

This study addresses a gap in understanding science communication dynamics by conceptualizing it as a complex adaptive system of actors. It introduces the CASSCO (Complex Adaptive System of Science Communication) model, which integrates complex adaptive systems theory with game theory to analyze strategic interactions in science communication. The model encompasses decision-making processes, impact evaluation, and learning mechanisms among actors, distinguishing between institutional and organizational roles across three communica-tion modes: dissemination, dialogue, and participation. By applying the CASSCO model to two scenarios - citizen science and generative AI \u2013 the study demonstrates its potential for predicting non-linear dynamics and emergent outcomes in science communication. This approach yields insights into the impact of communication strategies on public trust and contestations of science. The CASSCO model serves as a strategic thinking template, enabling actors to select strategies while considering the behaviors of others. The study concludes with theoretical and practical implications, model limitations, and future research directions.",

    "description": "As the concept of polycrisis gains popularity among academics, policy-makers, and the general public, many questions linger about the utility, scope, and applicability of the term in different contexts. Building on prior work, we argue that crises can fruitfully be understood as existing along a spectrum, characterized by multiple different factors, with our modern polycrisis at one extreme. We illustrate this by surveying three historical periods with varying geographical scope \u2013 late 1st-millennium CE Mesoamerica, Late Medieval Eurasia, and the early modern Northern Hemisphere \u2013 arguing that these exhibited many, but not all, of the key characteristics that make up a polycrisis. We detail the experience of individual societies during these periods, focused on regions to highlight how stresses and dysfunction across multiple systems combined to produce devastating impacts and contrast these with the relatively mild experiences of others facing the same conditions. We highlight how the interaction of stresses across ecological, economic, social, and political systems produced disasters that further deepened these crises and so led to yet more disasters and further devastation. We illustrate how viewing these historical periods through a polycrisis lens can not only inform our understanding of the past but can produce valuable lessons for our modern world. The multi-faceted, far-reaching, and devastating consequences of our current polycrisis should not be viewed as entirely a recent phenomenon. Ultimately, we argue that studying historical polycrises as we do here can help us learn lessons from the past that allow us to hone strategies for addressing the comparable issues we face today and will continue to contend with for the foreseeable future.",

In Study 1, we surveyed crowdworkers on marginalization-related characteristics and analyzed their annotations of racism. In Study 2, we assigned personas to LLMs and studied variations in the annotations. Moreover, we compared human and LLM coder bias from a text-level perspective to account for textual properties driving variation. Our findings suggest that being affected by or aware of marginalization causes systematic variation in human annotations, while persona assignment significantly impacts LLM outputs. Against this backdrop, we advocate for \u2018inclusive annotation\u2019 which introduces variance by intentionally integrating coders with lived experience or awareness of the constructs, thereby enriching measurement quality.",

    "description": "Social and environmental challenges are combining to form a polycrisis with potential to delay or reset many sustainability efforts. These risks raise questions about what capacities will be needed for advancing sustainability during a time of interlinked crises. Here, we evaluate the adequacy of adaptive and transformative capacities for navigating the polycrisis. Specifically, we perform a rapid assessment of their potential for addressing the 14 recently proposed Anthropocene traps. We find that ten Anthropocene traps have characteristics that challenge in total 17 of 23 adaptive and transformative capacities. On the other hand, 10 of 23 capacities - with an overrepresentation of transformative capacities - have general potential to prevent formation and progress of traps. Coevolutionary struggles between the expression of a capacity and the progression of traps are widespread. Importantly, transformative and adaptive capacities complement each other in the types of Anthropocene traps they most frequently address, with transformative capacities targeting global traps and adaptive capacities the emergent structural traps related to connectivity and pace of change. We end by proposing five unifying processes that can serve as an organizing framework for consideration of other sustainability and crisis capacities.",

    "description": "Cultural ecosystem services are non-material benefits people obtain from ecosystems; yet the indirect inspirational values of biodiversity, including both ecosystems and biological organisms, in creative literary works remain underexplored. This study investigated occurrences of biodiversity in the lyrics of Japanese popular songs based on monetary estimation, as an exploration of the inspirational value of biodiversity. I analyzed the lyrics of the top 50 songs from the Japanese CD singles chart over 22 years (1999\u20132020), extracting nouns related to ecosystems and organisms. The extracted words were classified into ecosystems and taxonomic groups, and the total sales amount of songs related to each class was calculated. Statistical analyses compared the occurrences and total sales amounts of songs containing biodiversity. Finally, I investigated the effect of richness of ecosystems and biological organisms within a song on its sales amount, using generalized linear mixed modeling to assess the prevalence of songs inspired by biodiversity. Out of 1,100 songs, 403 songs included references to ecosystems or biological organisms, with plants being the most frequently mentioned. Ecosystems that are familiar to Japanese people and biological organisms which they frequently encounter in their cultural and daily lives contributed to aesthetic inspiration in the lyrics of Japanese popular songs. Most importantly, I indicated that the existence of a single biological organisms within a song lyric can enhance its sales amount, namely prevalence to people. My result implies that the inclusion of a less well-known biological species within a song can indirectly inspire people, increasing recognition and willingness to conserve it.",

    "description": "Calorie labeling is a popular policy to address the obesity epidemic, but it has had little empirical success. Under the premise that willful avoidance of information plays a role in this result, we propose a novel approach\u2014pre-nudges\u2014to make consumers more receptive to calorie information. Unlike nudges, which are used to directly influence a choice, pre-nudges are used to directly influence how consumers react to the nudge itself (the calorie label). In line with predictions from our theoretical analysis, we test two pre-nudges in the context of menu labeling: one aims to increase self-efficacy, and the other one highlights the long-term health risks of overeating. In a large-scale laboratory experiment, we find that both pre-nudges reduce calorie information avoidance. Overall, our paper suggests a possible role for pre-nudges in addressing the obesity epidemic\u2014one of the largest public health issues globally\u2014and illustrates the potential usefulness of pre-nudges more generally",

    "link": "https://share.osf.io/preprint/E01B5-606-C2D",
    "description": "This report undertakes an analysis of social policy provision in the six rEUsilience countries from the perspective of resilience and the role of social policy. The analyses are based on a theoretical framework which defines resilience as families\u2019 capacity to adjust to situations of risk without negative outcome and interprets social policy as having both protective functions, such as support available throughout family-based transitions, and promotive functions, such as adequate income support, in affecting the conditions for families to be resilient. The report prioritises the protective aspects. It therefore considers how policy supports transitions for all parents between care and employment and how policy treats three particular types of family situation that the research identifies as needing extra support: parenting alone, caring for a children with a disability or illness, and coping with a migrant background. Consequently, five areas of policy are analysed: parenting-related leaves, early childhood education and care (ECEC), provisions for lone-parent families, provisions for families coping with a disability or illness on the part of a child, and provisions for families with a migration background adjusting or integrating into the new country. In response to the question of the extent to which the national and EU policy systems support families to be resilient, the analysis highlights a number of important findings. First, some policy fields seem to be better equipped, or further along the road, than others in helping families to be resilient. The policies oriented to transitions - parental leaves and ECEC \u2013 generally seem to be better developed then those for family situations with heightened risk. Second, conditions that exclude people from benefits and services reduce policies\u2019 effectiveness (from a resilience as well as other perspectives). Third, where the EU has set legal benchmarks most countries meet them, and so the significance of the EU as a policy agent is confirmed. But where the EU only makes \u2018soft recommendations\u2019, they do not seem to penetrate deeply into the national systems. Fourth, the recognition that some families need more has not fully penetrated the policy systems. One big issue is that of equivalence in support for lone-parent families vis-\u00e0-vis those with two parents. The dearth of information on and system knowledge about certain types of families, especially those coping with child illness and migrant families, is a general weakness found across countries.",

    "link": "https://share.osf.io/preprint/E01A2-3B8-B26",
    "description": "Regression discontinuity designs (RDD) and regression kink designs (RKD) are popular identification strategies across the social sciences. The relatively weak assumptions required for identifying a causal effect with RDD/RKDs make the designs attractive quasi-experimental methods for causal inference. One limitation of RDD/RKDs is that they rely on an exogenously given and previously known treatment rule. To overcome this limitation, economists (Porter & Yu 2015, Hansen 2017, Boehnke & Bonaldi 2019, and Tanu 2020) and computer scientists (Herlands et al. 2018) have begun to develop methods and tests that can find unknown discontinuities. However, these tests are either largely theoretically focused, computationally intensive, inconvenient to implement, or otherwise do not fit the specific needs of applied political scientists. Accordingly, this paper presents a novel, more f lexible, and extremely easy to implement approach to estimate unknown cut-points in both RDDs and RKDs. It is the first method that can detect unknown thresholds in both RDDs and RKDs. I call this method the unknown cut-point regression discontinuity/kink design (UCRDD/UCRKD). It works by uniformly dividing an assignment variable into quantiles to create a distribution of \u201ccandidate\u201d cut-points. Each candidate threshold is then tested in a RDD model (Imbens & Kalyanaraman 2012) to find the \u201cbest\u201d cut-point, the cut-point that has the largest substantive effect and highest degree of statistical significance. Researchers can use UCRDD/UCRKD to find \u201ctipping-points\u201d in behavior; to determine obscured or non-public policy criteria; and as a diagnostic tool to determine if there are other significant thresholds in their traditional RDD/RKD. In the application section, I apply UCRKD to assess how to define the concept of a minority district and to estimate the treatment effect of minority districts on electoral support for minority candidates.",

    "description": "Efforts to replicate portions of the scientific literature have lead to widely varying and often low rates of replicability. This has raised concerns over a ``replication crisis'' whereby many of the statistically significant claims in the published literature are thought to be false positives, due to some combination of publication bias and widespread use of questionable research practices. However, formal meta-scientific models invoking false positives lead to conclusions that often conflict with observational findings and require additional assumptions to reconcile varying rates of replicability across areas of research. Here, we present a minimal, alternative model of how replication failures can occur even in the absence of false positives. Using our model, we show that variation in estimates of replicability across social science is well explained as an artifact of replication sample size. We additionally demonstrate that key features of reformed science and multi-site replications can be explained without false positives. Our results are consistent with evidence suggesting that file-drawer sizes are likely much smaller, and Questionable Research Practices less abundant, than required by false positive models. We anticipate our findings will be a starting point for more formal and nuanced discussion of the health of the scientific literature and areas for improvement.",

    "description": "Homelessness has grown in the suburbs of Australian capital cities, with more than 60 per cent of those experiencing homelessness at the 2021 Census found in Australia\u2019s capital cities (up from around 48% in 2001). Homelessness has increased especially in areas with greater shortages of affordable private rental housing (relative to demand from low income households). The research, \u2018The changing geography of homelessness in Australia (2001\u201321) and its structural drivers\u2019, undertaken for AHURI by researchers from Swinburne University of Technology, Launch Housing and RMIT University, investigates the changing geography of homelessness in Australia from 2001 to 2021 and the role of structural factors, such as poverty and supplies of affordable rental housing, in shaping this geography. Homelessness was also higher in areas with smaller supplies of social housing relative to demand. The research suggests that an increase in social housing will further significantly reduce homelessness. In areas with a greater shortage of affordable rental dwellings, a higher percentage of Specialist Homelessness Service clients are returning for support after having been assisted. As the majority of people experiencing homelessness tend to remain in the same area, localised responses to homelessness are really important. Homelessness services and affordable housing options need to be expanded in areas where they are needed, and not just where existing services are located. In order to provide housing to clients who accessed a Specialist Homelessness Service in 2021\u201322, the research estimated that around 158,000 one- to two-bedroom dwellings and 25,000 three-or-more-bedroom dwellings are needed nationally. These dwellings must be affordable and available to households with the lowest incomes.",

    "description": "Neuroscience is traditionally considered a branch of biology, with interdisciplinary influences from a wide range of fields including psychology, computer science, engineering and mathematics. As a result, a computational approach to neuroscience has emerged that analyzes human brain activity as the superposition of signals that yield complex rhythms and nonlinear dynamics. The computational approach assumes that normative properties, such as value, meaning and purpose, that are highly relevant to humanity are somehow emergent from these otherwise mechanical interactions. Here, I propose that brain dynamics reflect an organic whole that, in the words of Iain McGilchrist, is \u201cinextricably linked with values, meaning and purpose.\u201d This proposal suggests that brain activity can be investigated as a \u201ckind of music:\u201d a global, emotive form, the shape of which contains nested information regarding vital physiology and embodied emotionality. Using electroencephalography (EEG) as an example, and drawing on the field of musicology, I review historical and recent evidence that reveals how neurodynamics can be seen more like music or an artistic creation: multi-scale, context sensitive, dynamically evolving, and intrinsically meaningful. This \u201cneurodynamics of music\u201d hypothesis is investigated using a geometric framework that includes rhythms and nonlinear dynamics, but where those properties must be understood in the context of the vital metabolism of living organisms. Vital, homeostatic and emotional signals underpin the recurrent play of anticipation and fulfillment in life, brain activity and from which, differentiated meaning is sculpted from the global whole. Neuroscience can benefit from the tools of the humanities informing its analytic methods, theoretical assumptions and interpretive frameworks. Through reengagement with the musical heart of neurodynamics, we may be more inclined to see our brains, our minds, and ourselves, as creatively meaningful, purposeful and alive.",

    "description": "Despite extensive focus on the rise in midlife mortality in the U.S. in recent years, the implications of this trend for children\u2019s exposure to parental death\u2014or bereavement\u2014remain minimally explored. In this study, we introduce a new approach to estimate trends in children\u2019s exposure to co-resident parental death in the U.S over the past 25 years (1999-2023). Our methodological approach relies on a fusion model and data simulation that joins recent population and mortality data to estimate children\u2019s exposure to co-resident parental death. The results reveal a subtle rise in parental death each year since the early 2010s: in 2023 alone, more than 300,000 children experienced a co-resident parent\u2019s death. The results further demonstrate that the long-running, steady increase in the annual number of parentally bereaved children accumulates to more than 2.4 million children under 18 in 2023 having ever experienced a parent\u2019s death\u2014representing approximately 3.2% of the child population. The results further demonstrate race and ethnic disparities, with non-Hispanic Indigenous children especially at risk of parental death. Together, the results attest to the need for a comprehensive policy response to support parentally bereaved children, and the need for further scholarly recognition of this uniquely consequential childhood adversity.",

    "link": "https://share.osf.io/preprint/E0055-D1D-B2B",
    "description": "Utilizing Large Language Models (LLM), this study investigates the evolution of an innovative social security policy idea, the General Benefit concept into a policy reform proposal in Fin-land from 2007 to 2023. Drawing from the ideational analysis we hypothesize that political parties struggled over social security conditionality during the 2010s and that social security simplification was manipulated differently in relation to conditionality. Our primary data is elec-tion manifestos and governmental programs from 2007-2023. We employed LLMs, mainly a customized ChatGPT, for the text analysis of policy documents. Additionally, we conduct a critical human evaluation of the LLMs analysis and publish our model in the GPT store for the open replication of analyses. Findings indicate that the weakening of the tripartite industrial relations system and the break-ing of \u201cstatus quo of three big parties\u201d allowed new parties to influence social policy in 2010s. The General Benefit emerged as a response to calls for social security simplification and for countering (unconditional) basic income proposals. Adopted in 2023, the General Benefit concept aims to merge Finnish universal / residence-based social insurance benefits for the working-aged while preserving core principles like social risk categories and conditionality. Despite increased nativism from the rising True Finns party, and the adoption of universal / unconditional basic income by several parties, Finnish social policy trends from 2007 to 2023 continued to emphasize employment and public finance sustainability. Our study also contributes to methodological discussions on using LLMs in policy analysis. The \u201chuman evaluation\u201d, performed by the authors, confirms that the LLM analysis accurately summarises the main features of the policy evolution. However, we also found that the LLM lacks ability to recognise the nuances of \u201cmultidimensional\u201d political language and is not very helpful in cross-sectional evaluation, which leaves the analysis partly shallow. Thus, we con-clude that in qualitative policy analysis, LLMs in their current form are suitable for comple-menting rather than substituting human evaluation.",

    "description": "The Court of Justice frequently redrafts the questions submitted to it by the national courts in the context of the preliminary reference procedure. The practice is known as reformulation, and oftentimes determines a change to the substance of the question, which is referred to in this article as substantial reformulation. The Court justifies its use in the need to provide a useful answer to the national court. This article empirically investigates how the Court uses the submissions of the parties and other materials in the case to substantially reformulate. To do so, it builds a framework of analysis to observe the possible influence of the parties in the changes to the dispute and the justifications used by the Court. The analysis relies on a unique dataset of 380 hand-coded preliminary rulings on interpretation. The findings confirm that substantive reformulation at the Court is frequent and significant. In reformulating the dispute, the Court draws on the materials submitted by the parties, and their influence can be traced to the questions actually replied to by the Court. Yet, the influence of the parties in setting the boundaries of the dispute must not be overstated, as it remains fully within the Court\u2019s control when to reformulate and which materials to use to do so. Furthermore, it is difficult to identify patterns in the Court\u2019s use of substantial reformulation. Providing a sufficient answer is a convenient excuse, but it does not seem to fully explain the findings of the article. The article explores other possible explanations for the increasingly frequent revert to reformulation.",

    "description": "This paper presents a novel statistical framework for modeling systems of potentially overlapping subgroups in cross-sectional network data, adhering to prior assumptions about the mean and variance of the number of actors per subgroup and the number of subgroups per actor. A stationary two-mode Stochastic Actor-Oriented Model is specified to obtain the distribution of actors' memberships in subgroups. Subgroups emerge from actors' decisions to join one or more subgroups. Cohesion of these subgroups is modeled by actors' strong preference to be in the same subgroups as their network contacts. The model is estimated using the Method of Moments, with target statistics derived from the prior assumptions. Evaluation statistics are defined to measure the cohesion and variability of the generated systems of subgroups. As a proof of concept, we model cohesive subgroups in a high-school friendship network, where students are assumed to belong to unobserved peer groups. The results indicate that actors form cohesive subgroups of varying composition, characterized by denser overlaps when actors prefer multiple memberships with their network contacts.",

    "description": "Whilst there are many new opportunities for using emerging technology to enhance citizen engagement with government decision-making, there are still challenges using existing technologies and many failed initiatives, especially in Africa. These failures are often put down to a mismatch in culture and values, between the local African context and technologies developed in other parts of the world, and between the agile openness of digital initiatives and the bureaucratic practices of public officials. Unfortunately, little is known about the specific roles public officials do or could play in e-participation implementation, how these roles are shaped by distinctive values, and the extent to which these values may conflict or, possibly, complement each other. This paper presents results from a desktop analysis of e-participation projects, largely from the African continent, and shows how a diversity of public official roles and values would be necessary to support the realisation of e-participation outcomes.

We use high quality survey and administrative data from Denmark, Finland, Germany and the UK for the period of 1990-2018 and monitor incomes after job loss using a difference-in-differences design. Our findings reveal significant penalties on household incomes (around 4-6% of previous earnings) for most countries that are higher in the UK in the short-term and relatively persistent and long-term in Finland and Germany. Market appears to be the primary mechanism of compensation in all countries, while the relative importance of household and state compensations vary across countries in line with their compensation strategies. State compensation generally plays a crucial role in mitigating immediate income losses except for the UK, while market compensation becomes more important over time in all countries. Household compensation mainly acts as a substitute for other types of compensations, and is therefore significantly higher in the UK and Germany where market and/or state compensations are much lower compared to the Nordics.",

    "description": "As populations age and informal caregiving becomes more widespread, the health consequences of providing care are becoming a key concern for societies. Sociological theories of stress appraisal and role strain posit detrimental consequences to the health and wellbeing of caregivers. Conversely, role enhancement theory holds that caregiving can have positive health consequences. Using data from the English Longitudinal Study of Aging (ELSA) collected among adults aged 50 years or older with a follow-up period of up to 20 years (2002-23, N ca. 20,000 persons), we examine associations between transitions into and out of caregiving, and two key health outcomes which have been understudied as consequences of caregiving, namely: allostatic load and cognitive functioning. We estimate asymmetric fixed-effects models which model changes in health outcomes as a function of transitions into and out of caregiving while accounting for unobserved between-person heterogeneity. Our results show that caregiving is associated with better cognitive health for both men and women, but not with improved biomarker-based allostatic load. Results do not differ by caregiving intensity, irrespective of which amount of time is defined as intense caregiving. Our findings provide support for role enhancement theory, suggesting that caregivers benefit in terms of cognitive functioning, even if a biomarker-based approach to measuring stress-related health outcome does not corroborate an overall health benefit. We formulate implications for policy-making and directions for future research.",

The study used a survey questionnaire to collect data from 80 participants, which were then analyzed using statistical methods. The results showed that higher levels of EI were positively correlated with better English language proficiency. The study also found that certain affective factors, such as empathy, self-awareness, and emotional regulation, were particularly important in predicting ELL outcomes. The different affective factors are assessed on different grading scales. Considering the statistical analysis, it could be determined that factors related to the English language, such as social skills, motivation (both intrinsic and extrinsic), emotional regulation, effective communication, empathy, self-confidence, self- and cultural awareness, and resilience, have a positive and affirmative influence on the beliefs of English language learners. On the other hand, when analyzing the main challenges faced by Saudi female EFL students in developing emotional intelligence for learning English a majority of students favored that it is challenging to use EI to manage stress and emotions while learning a second language. Therefore, cultivating EL could maintain motivation and enthusiasm for learning English. The study pointed out that learning a second language is a challenging task, and it becomes even more difficult when one has to navigate and adapt to cultural differences. The study strongly favored the integration of the affective factors in teaching as well. Research suggested that a supportive and encouraging environment, positive feedback and constructive criticism could enhance the EI of Saudi female EFL students learning English. With the use of EI, students felt supported and encouraged, and they were more likely to feel confident in their abilities and take risks in their language learning.",

    "link": "https://share.osf.io/preprint/E0185-807-42A",
    "description": "Technical and Vocational Education and Training has gained importance but there is a noticeable gap between its research and teaching. While its teaching is more dynamic the research writing is scarce despite the performance measure demands. Rapid technological advancements, the multifaceted roles of the teachers, and the second language barrier escalate the pressure on research performance measures. Language models for research writing can help to alleviate research writing language practices. This paper explores the language practices of highly cited research articles for the technical and vocational education and training application. Specifically, it looks at how prolific writers write. Given the pressing need for a more accessible and more descriptive language model for technical and vocational research writing, this paper aims to assist by presenting techniques derived from the analysis of 62 highly cited research articles indexed in Scopus. Using move analysis, the study identifies 14 emerging techniques used in the introduction sections, offering a model for the writers and instructors. The techniques highlighted in this study not only enhance the engagement of introductions but also aim to increase readership and citation rates.",

    "description": "Aligning market demands with the knowledge, competencies, and skills provided by higher education is a significant challenge and often falls primarily on the shoulders of educators. This study aims to explore the concept of inclusive AI learning design and its intersection with the integration of the 6Cs framework in higher education. In other words, it delves into the multifaceted role of Artificial Intelligence in the classroom, focusing primarily on the integration of the 6Cs (communication, collaboration, critical thinking, creativity, character education/ connectivity, and culture/ citizenship) in Moroccan higher education institutions, Artificial Intelligence literacy, and the cultivation of digital humanities techniques. The main research question guiding the study was \u201cHow to integrate the 6Cs at the tertiary level using inclusive Artificial Intelligence learning design? \u00bb. The study held significance in contributing to the existing literature by providing new insights and filling gaps in knowledge. To achieve the objectives of the study, the researcher relied on an exploratory descriptive approach through an interview and a self-developed questionnaire involving 15 ESP teachers. The results indicated that teachers face several challenges when integrating the 6C of 21st-century education into ESP classes, including engineering students\u2019 low motivation, difficulties in combining multiple competencies, limitations in teaching materials, and time management issues. Hence, establishing a framework for inclusive Artificial Intelligence learning design that encompasses the 6 Cs is compulsory.",

The study adopted a quantitative method to analyse the ICNALE written essays v2.4 using CPIDR v5.1 software. The study aimed to identify the level of propositional idea density in the writing of English native speakers and Asian learners of English and to examine the effect of the type of English, the theme type, the proficiency level and nationality on propositional idea density. The study is one of the very few studies about propositional idea density in ESL and EFL contexts. Many statistical analyses were performed on CPIDR results using jamovi v2.3 software, and the results of the tests revealed that the propositional idea density in native speakers\u2019 essays was higher than that in Asian learners\u2019 essays. Moreover, the results showed that there was a statistically significant difference among all the participants based on the theme types of part-time jobs and smoking, among native speakers based on occupation type (students, teachers, others) and among Asian learners of English based on the type of English proficiency level and nationality. The findings of the study showed that propositional idea density is a psycholinguistic index of the amount of presupposed knowledge language users have on a specific topic. In other words, propositional idea density is a window to language users\u2019 schemata. Additionally, the findings of the study can be considered an insightful contribution to contrastive interlanguage analysis.",

    "description": "Project-Based Learning (PBL) can potentially enhance learners\u2019 oral proficiency. However, little evidence supports how PBL improves learners\u2019 complexity, accuracy, and fluency, particularly for learners with different proficiency levels. This study examined the changes and linguistic features of varying proficiency learners\u2019 complexity, accuracy, and fluency within a PBL context. It involved a homogeneous group of 45 Chinese college learners, categorized into high (N=15), medium (N=15), and low proficiency learners (N=15). Their oral complexity, accuracy, and fluency were assessed using speaking tests before and after PBL. The changes in their oral performance were evaluated using objective measures of complexity, accuracy, and fluency. The transcripts were also used to analyze the linguistic features of different proficiency learners. The results indicate that PBL significantly enhances syntactic complexity as learners\u2019 proficiency levels increase. Significant differences were observed in lexical complexity, pronunciation accuracy, and self-repairs between high and low-proficiency learners. However, no significant differences were found in syntactic accuracy and speech rate across high, medium, and low proficiency learners. The findings also indicate that different proficiency learners reveal various linguistic features of syntactic complexity, syntactic accuracy, and self-repairs in their oral performance. This study provides implications for educators to design project-based activities for different proficiency learners to improve their complexity, accuracy, and fluency.",

    "description": "The purpose of this study is to explore the relationship between reading strategies and Bandura\u2019s (1986) theory of Reciprocal Determinism. Previous research acknowledged the concept of Reciprocal Determinism as an effective teaching approach, however, limited research has been done to consider how reading is influenced by learners\u2019 personal factors, behavior and environment. Based on four Research Questions, the study explores the perceived use of reading strategies by 225 undergraduates who completed a critical reading course at a local university. These learners of English as a Second Language responded to an online questionnaire adapted from Mokhtari and Sheorey\u2019s (2002) Survey of Reading Strategies. Based on the learners\u2019 ratings of the reading strategies, namely Global Reading Strategies, Problem-Solving Strategies and Support Strategies, the findings revealed that there is a significant relationship between the learners\u2019 perceived use of reading strategies and the three factors of Reciprocal Determinism, namely Personal Factors, Behaviour and Environment indicating a cyclical effect that infuences learners\u2019 reading comprehension. This exploration of reading strategies through this theory has pedagogical implications on how reading is taught to scaffold and help learners increase metacognitive awareness and self-efficacy. Overall, this study contributes to a further understanding of the importance of taking into account the three factors in a reading environment and the relationship between reading strategies and RD. Future studies could be an extension of how the cyclical effects of Reciprocal Determinism and reading strategies could be strategically integrated into the teaching of skilled and unskilled readers and in other learning domains",

This study examines the utilization of CAT tools in the freelance industry in Saudi Arabia. Fulford and Granell-Zafra (2005) have proposed a model that incorporates both information and Communication Technology (ICTs)and CAT tools, facilitating a diverse array of activities such as document creation, information search and retrieval, communication, business management, marketing, procurement, and translation. While CAT tools support document creation, business management, and translation, ICT tools are responsible for the remaining activates . This research aims to thoroughly analyze the characteristics of Saudi freelance translators who use CAT tools, evaluate their usage of CAT tools, and acquire valuable insights into their overall attitudes towards CAT tool. The data was gathered using the survey method and distributed among 98 Saudi freelance translators. The data was analyzed using SPSS descriptive analysis and frequency tables showing percentages of each respondent. The results show that Saudi freelance translators employed general-purpose software like MS Word and MS PowerPoint, whereas less interest was given to special-purpose software which represent CAT tools . The vast majority of the participants agreed on the positive effect of CAT tools. Finally,it may be beneficial to conduct further research to gain a more comprehensive understanding of the topic.",

As AI becomes increasingly prevalent, use, conflict and development have progressed rapidly, generating a boom in dialogue regarding what a future with AI could potentially look like. I examine discourse on AI in relation to notions of futurity and expertise. While these have been studied qualitatively through analysis of government memos and news media, cutting edge innovation discussed on social media that has not garnered mainstream attention remains understudied. As utilized by cultural sociologists, computational text analysis offers new possibilities in the study of meanings and framings. However, short texts remain understudied due to limitations in existing methods and approaches. I contend that short text limitations can be overcome by focusing on the meaning of sentences as opposed to the meaning of words and I demonstrate the utility of such an approach through two-stage topic modeling in my study of AI, particularly around how notions of futurity and domain-specific expertise are operationalized.

    "description": "This study explores the role of the Internet of Things (IoT) in the dissemination of cultural content, focusing on the transmission of Norse mythology and Orthodox Christian religious values within Romania, a culture with no historical connection to Norse mythology. By statistically analysing data collected from digital platforms such as TikTok and X (formerly Twitter), the research examines the differences in the presence and language of posts related to culturally specific content (Orthodox Christianity) and non-specific content (Norse mythology). The findings reveal that cultural content with strong institutional and historical support, like Orthodox Christianity, shows a higher prevalence and consistency in its digital dissemination, often transcending language barriers. Conversely, Norse mythology, lacking such support in Romania, demonstrates a more fragmented and inconsistent digital presence. The study also uncovers the influence of social media algorithms on the retrieval and representation of cultural content, highlighting significant quantitative and qualitative differences in search results between different users. These findings suggest that while the IoT facilitates global cultural exchange, it also introduces challenges in preserving the authenticity of cultural content in digital environments. The implications of this research extend to understanding the mechanisms of cultural hybridisation and the potential for digital platforms to both preserve and transform cultural heritage.",

    "description": "This paper explores the perceptions of Gen Z students at different levels of English proficiency regarding the use of technology, particularly Neural Machine Translation (NMT) and ChatGPT, in second language acquisition. The research aims to understand how these technologies influence language learning and identify how these tools are used across varying proficiency levels. The significance of the study lies in its potential to inform educators and highlight the role of using technologies in language learning. Based on data collected from a survey of 151 students (ranging from A2 to C2 proficiency levels), the findings indicate that students across all proficiency levels actively engage with NMT and ChatGPT. Across all proficiency levels, NMT and ChatGPT are used primarily for word translation. However, higher proficiency students use ChatGPT for complex tasks (such as mistake correction or summary writing). Moreover, the study emphasizes the positive attitudes of Gen Z learners toward technology as a flexible and valuable educational resource. The motivation to use technology stems from the desire to learn new vocabulary, comprehend English content, and enjoy flexible learning. Therefore, the study recommends that educators adapt teaching strategies to include these technologies, considering the different proficiency levels of students. Future research should focus on the long-term impacts of technology use on language acquisition.",

Autism Spectrum Disorder is characterized by unique challenges in social communication and interaction, which also affect intellectual activities such as reading comprehension. The study is significant as it attempts to identify the critical factors for successful ESL reading comprehension instruction for autistic students. The study conducts an analysis of existing literature on the challenges faced by educators while teaching their autistic students. These challenges include communication, sensory processing,  thinking, and language structural deficiencies. The article also emphasises the presence of effective facilitators like a whole-school approach and immersion in research learning communities, which aid teachers in enhancing their students\u2019 reading comprehension skills development. Teachers can utilize visual supports, scaffolding, and multisensory approaches to assist their students\u2019 learning process. Implementing a whole-school management approach and team collaboration also fosters a supportive environment for developing teachers\u2019 capabilities. Teachers can engage with current research and development through participation in structured opportunities such as research learning communities.

    "description": "In the last few decades, pragmatic competence has become one of the issues that captured academic attention in education settings. Yet, teachers\u2019 perceptions of pragmatics and teaching pragmatics has yet to be closely investigated in the context of Moroccan higher education and therefore remains uncharted in literature. To address these gaps, the present study explored how Moroccan university professors view pragmatics and pragmatic teaching. It also explored how they use their pragmatic knowledge in the classroom. A total of 10 university professors (6 males and 4 females) from two public universities (Moulay Ismail and Sidi Mohammed Ben Abdellah) in Morocco participated in the current study. Quantitative data were collected by completing an anonymous questionnaire, while qualitative data were collected through semi-structured interviews. Participants expressed their perceptions and described experiences of the importance of teaching pragmatics, issues related to culture and identity in teaching English as a Foreign Language, and materials and tasks in teaching pragmatics. The findings yielded that linguistic knowledge is as essential as pragmatic knowledge. Thus, striking a balance between pragmatic and grammatical competence and teaching them simultaneously is crucial. Learners with advanced grammatical knowledge may fail to use the target language appropriately. As such, the results indicated that some teachers are unaware of the importance of introducing pragmatics to students in the early stages of learning English. Their skills are enough to be good at transmitting cultural knowledge and suitable language competence to students. Practical implications for future research and practice are also discussed.",

Thus, this mixed-methods study aimed to fill this gap by investigating the impact of the POA on Chinese university students\u2019 motivation for English learning. The quantitative results demonstrated significant improvements in both intrinsic and extrinsic motivation among the students instructed by the POA. The qualitative data supported these findings, revealing that the structured stages of the POA, along with its core principles, created a supportive and engaging learning environment.

    "description": "This paper compares processes of labour market entry and early career stages in Britain and West Germany. It starts by looking at the characteristics of the respective institutional structures in which human capital is formed and allocated. The two national systems of formal institutions can be regarded as generating particular modes of co-ordination between education and the labour market, that is that the labour market integration of young people follows different rules in the two countries. A frame of reference is provided by a general model that distinguishes between a horizontal, a vertical and a temporal dimension of the process of integration into the labour market. These dimensions are further pursued in empirical terms: here, major aims of the paper are to assess the effects of formal qualifications on the quality of first jobs and to analyse the multi-dimensional stability of entry positions in early careers. In Britain, co-ordination is, to a larger extent, achieved by criteria of timing, in addition to the hierarchical grading of qualifications; in Germany the latter, as well as substantive occupational skills, play a major role. There have also been important historical changes in these dimensions, especially in the UK.",

Yet occupations are not easily translated into a linear hierarchical measure. Influential scales combine multiple indicators and lack intuitive interpretation. We present a new scale based on occupations\u2019 earnings potential (OEP). The OEP scale measures the median earnings of occupations and expresses them as percentiles of the overall earnings structure: If machine mechanics earn the national median wage, their OEP is 50. We construct national OEP scales using annual microdata pooled over several decades for Germany, Sweden, Switzerland, the UK and US. Consistent with the Treiman constant, these national scales are highly correlated over time (r=0.90) and across countries (r=0.80), justifying the use of one common OEP scale. When applied to another European database, the common OEP scale explains a quarter of the variance in earnings \u2013 and performs as well for countries used to construct the scale as for countries not used. Moreover, it is associated with the causes (education) and consequences (social mobility) that theory expects it to be.

    "description": "Studies of the effects of immigration on redistribution preferences mostly focus on Western countries and neglect the South-South contexts. However, we argue that immigration shocks may have different effects in South-South regions. On the one hand, the effect should be more muted due to the minimal cultural differences and the limited development of the welfare state. On the other hand, the impact might be even larger due to high inequality and scarce resources. To investigate this, we exploit the 2015 Venezuelan immigration shock in Colombia using a shift-share instrument and an event study, finding non-significant effects. Moreover, a survey experiment reveals that priming citizens on immigration has null-to-positive effects on redistribution preferences. We attribute this to deservingness considerations, due to cultural similarities between Venezuelan immigrants and the host population. These results challenge some prevailing theories and suggest that increased immigration does not necessarily reduce redistribution preferences in South-South contexts.",

    "description": "Background: Social media's rapid evolution has increased exposure to suspected suicides, driven by the democratisation of media content through polymediated transmission. There is a wide gap in our understanding of the impact of this phenomenon, and no research from preventive public and mental health perspectives. This study aimed to examine social media exposure to suspected suicide and its impact on communities from the perspectives of public and mental health. Methods: Knowledge Exchange workshops and in-depth interviews with public health and mental health professionals who work in a responding capacity following a suspected suicide informed the study. Their observations and experiences provided insights into polymediated exposure: how platforms operate, user behaviour, context of use, impact on communities and challenges and opportunities for intervention. A thematic and narrative analysis of qualitative data was conducted. Results: The study emphasises polymedia as a theoretical framework for understanding how the intertwining of diverse social media platforms transforms the way narratives relating to suspected suicides unfold. Analysis of the communicative ecology of social media highlighted the dual potential of social media content to both amplify and mitigate the risk of suicide. Data underscored the role of social media in fuelling increased exposure to harmful discourse in multiple and often unexpected ways, contributing to the copycat effect. Responsible content moderation and protective discourse can reverse these effects; however, these efforts may be compromised by algorithms that favour the Werther effect and social media\u2019s connection to users\u2019 reduced attention span, which affects their capacity to think before posting. Conclusion: This study contributes important new knowledge into the ways in which social media transforms exposure to suicide and compelling new evidence for direct impact on communities. As the public play an increasingly active role in generating new forms of media and narratives surrounding suspected suicides, Polymedia theory and the communicative ecology of social media emerge as pivotal factors that warrant a more prominent role in shaping suicide prevention policy. Responding to and managing social media risks requires a new, coordinated public health approach that goes beyond existing guidelines. There is a clear call for the augmentation of existing guidelines to encompass the dynamic nature of social media's influence, involving public health and allied organisations in this crucial endeavour.

    "description": "We propose a theoretical framework to explain fertility declines over the past two centuries around the world. The framework suggests that low-fertility countries already entered and will persist in a fertility equilibrium in the foreseeable future. What distinguishes our theoretical framework from the previous ones is the centrality of women in our model. The woman has a different interest in fertility decisions from others including her male partner. In most human history, her input in fertility decisions was minimal. As the premodern regime begins to crumble, women gradually become aware of other life choices and obtain reproductive autonomy. These changes inevitably lead to falls in fertility. The falls are ultimately driven by the push for broad gender equality and would continue and not be permanently reversed until they meet pronatalistic forces in a below-replacement environment where the antinatalistic and pronatalistic forces balance out into a fertility equilibrium.",

    "link": "https://share.osf.io/preprint/E018E-890-667",
    "description": "Countries with stronger support to gender equality tend to invest in policies supporting the dual-earner family model or the earner/carer family model, while countries with stronger support to conservative gender norms tend to have policies supporting the male breadwinner family model. However, gender equality norms can be endorsed by the majority of the population at the national level, whilst conservative norms could still be largely supported at the sub-national level, potentially leading to lower uptake of parental leave among fathers in more conservative areas. This study seeks to examine shifting norms in fathers\u2019 parental leave uptake in Finnish municipalities in the 2010s, around the first reform that gave fathers an independent right to a 6-week quota of \u201csolo\u201d parental leave. We applied a Bayesian spatio-temporal model on administrative data from Finnish municipalities and estimated local norms based on voting data and content analysis of political manifestos. Furthermore, we used the proportion of Swedish residents as a proxy for cross-border policy influences from the neighbouring country Sweden, where paternal leave-taking has been a longer phenomenon. Local support to de-familialising policies was found to predict higher leavetaking, but only before the 2013 reform when fathers\u2019 quota use shortened mothers\u2019 leave. The proportion of Swedish-speaking residents was found to be increasingly important for predicting paternal leave-taking. We interpret this result as a sign of cross-border influences from Sweden. Interestingly, uptake increased the fastest in the most conservative region, probably due to its strong linguistic and cultural links to Sweden. Furthermore, we observed spatial dependencies between neighbouring municipalities, which supports our spillover hypothesis; that the interactions among families nearby lead them to adopt new practices. These results trigger new theoretical considerations concerning the role of gender norms in affecting citizens\u2019 behaviour in the family policy field and how these norms interact with policy reforms, the role of national institutions in affecting welfare state preferences at the local level, and the importance of community socialisation.",

    "description": "The severe armed conflict in Ethiopia since November 2020 \u2013 the start of an armed insurrection by a party (TPLF) in northern Ethiopia - has been framed and impacted upon by digital offensives and global media reporting in peculiar ways. Representations of the conflict events, actors and victims have had a divisive effect on political debate and cooperation in Ethiopia, thus fuelling communal divisions and preventing compromise. The arena of shared politics in federal Ethiopia was further fragmented, with a notable role played by influential global news media and the \u2018social\u2019 media. Their politic rhetoric went beyond strategies of persuasion into forms of partisan intimidation, misinformation, bias and even fiction. As with all early 21th-century armed conflicts (cf. the Middle East, Myanmar, or Ukraine), the digital sphere and media manipulation on Ethiopia are shown to be essential domains of discursive battle, extending real life battles, and impacting on international diplomatic responses. The paper analyses some key aspects of the evolving conflict from the perspective of repeated digital \u2018memes\u2019 \u2013 \u2018famine\u2019, \u2018genocide\u2019, \u2018blockade\u2019, ethnic cleansing\u2019 - and narrative frames \u2013 \u2018underdog\u2019, \u2018self-defense\u2019, \u2018peaceful resolution\u2019, \u2018truce\u2019 - produced by adherents of one or the other party in the conflict. This contemporary (digital) political rhetoric subverts itself and creates a world of semi-fictitious appearances that perpetuate conflict. The problem of addressing \u2018Sophist\u2019 arguments is the same as in Plato\u2019s time (cf. Gorgias), but current digital media allow political rhetoric to massively go beyond the conventions of shared discourse. Using examples, I argue that, beyond the analysis of the digital and news media products themselves, new ways have to be found to \u2018reality-check\u2019 or reduce these products/representations to themes amenable for public discussion and eventual shared compromise (cf. Norris 2017: 630). This might help (re)building political rhetoric in a constructive, and not exclusively polemic, manner.",

Following the Nordic schema, the Finnish leave system is designed around this concept to encourage leave uptake, but a substantial share of fathers refrain from it. Though there is a substantial body of literature on policy and individual-level motivators of leave uptake, the decision to take leave often occurs in the context of the workplace. Workplace factors are often cited as typical barriers to uptake. We systematically investigated how the most important workplace characteristics are associated with fathers\u2019 parental leave decisions. We used administrative, linked employee-employer Finnish register data and a multilevel Bayesian approach to examine employed first-time fathers\u2019 use of the father\u2019s quota in 2013\u20132017. Contrary to our expectations, the probability of taking father\u2019s quota did not vary by the gender composition of or gender wage gap within the workplace. Workplace educational level was important, but only for tertiary educated fathers. Increased competitiveness of the workplace lowered the probability of taking the quota.

This article examines whether family responsibilities, measured as the age and number of children, act as motivators or barriers to formal AE participation differently among men and women with varying time and monetary resources, that is, partnership status and relative income, in two societies with high formal AE enrolment rates; Finland and Great Britain. The results from Finnish registers and Understanding Society for 1998\u20132019 demonstrate clearly that family responsibilities related to having young children in the household restrict women from participating in formal AE to a greater extent than men in both countries. Further, while Finnish society enables individuals who traditionally have fewer resources to attend formal AE, that is, single parents and larger families, in Britain, formal AE is mainly taken up by individuals without children or those in stable family situations.

We investigate one potential mechanism behind ethnic segregation; native flight from schools. In contexts where school enrollment is determined primarily by geographic proximity to schools, Native or White parents with a preference for schools with low minority concentrations may choose to move away from schools with higher minority concentrations among students, contributing to both residential and school segregation. Using detailed, population-wide, geo-coded register data on families and school catchment areas for elementary schools in Oslo, Norway, we investigate whether native parents move away from schools with higher shares of students with non-Western immigrant backgrounds. We first show that native origin families systematically move away from schools with high shares of students with non-Western immigrant backgrounds. Employing a Geographic Regression Discontinuity design, exploiting the fact that catchment area borders sort neighboring children into different schools, our results indicate that such moves may be causally linked to local school characteristics, not just their neighborhoods. This may contribute to segregation in schools and neighborhoods. However, the results are ambiguous and sensitive to model specifications, and more research is needed to draw firm conclusions.",

    "description": "The super-rich rarely discuss their lives in public. On the rare occasion that they do so, provide interesting insights into the self-legitimization strategies. In this article, we study the discursive construction of wealth accumulation through arguments, frames, and metaphors drawing on the Sociology of cultural processes in the (re-)production of inequality. We use interviews with wealthy German family business owners in media outlets between 2014 and 2019. Applying thematic analysis, we demonstrate that these wealthy business owners discursively link the past, present, and future of their family and business. By doing so, they emphasize hard work to explain family wealth transitions and how such wealth is accumulated across generations. This temporal self-narration about business success tied to family structure creates a powerful discursive strategy to legitimize their wealth. Our findings contribute to the emerging field of media studies on the super-rich and wealthy dynasties.",

    "description": "Infection with Respiratory Syncytial Virus (RSV) is associated with tens of thousands of hospitalizations in a typical year. Most US adults are not likely to experience severe cases of RSV infection, but adults aged 60 or older are at elevated risk of experiencing hospitalization or death due to RSV. While RSV vaccines are available for adults aged 60 or older, and have been shown to significantly reduce the likelihood that older adults experience severe cases of RSV, less than one quarter of those eligible have opted to receive the vaccine. In the context of RSV vaccination, Reversal Narrative (RN) messages share stories about individuals who previously refused to receive the vaccine, but \u2013 in response to personal negative health outcomes (\u201cregret\u201d RN messaging) and/or new scientific information (\u201crationalizing\u201d RN messaging) \u2013 ultimately changed their mind. In a large and nationally representative survey (N = 1,300) of US adults, as well as a state-representative survey (N = 850) of a highly vaccinated US state, we demonstrate that unvaccinated adults over the age of 60 are significantly more likely to intend to receive an RSV vaccine when exposed to regret-focused (but not rationalizing) RN messaging. We conclude by discussing the viability of RN messaging as a vaccine promotion tactic, and consider how researchers might partner with health communicators to explore their viability in a wide range of health contexts.",

    "description": "Importance: While high levels of annual vaccination remains a key strategy for preventing the spread of new COVID-19 variants, most eligible Americans chose not to receive an updated vaccine in 2023. Objective: To assess the effectiveness of two new COVID-19 vaccine uptake communication strategies on annual COVID-19 vaccine uptake among vaccine hesitant sub-populations in a high vaccination state, and determine whether or not the messages \u201cscale up\u201d into an effective national messaging strategy. Design: We administered four randomized controlled trials embedded in two large and representative public opinion surveys before and following the availability of updated COVID-19 vaccines. Trials 1 and 2 were conducted in June 2023, and randomly exposed a representative cross-section of adults in a highly vaccinated state (Rhode Island; Trial 1, N = 800) and a nationally representative cross-section US adults (Trial 2, N = 1,000) with messages that normalize the risks posed by endemic COVID-19 (vs. a control group). Trials 3 and 4 were conducted in October 2023, and randomly exposed analogous state (Trial 3, N = 800) and nationally representative survey respondents (Trial 4, N = 1,200) to messages that \u201cde-normalize\u201d constantly-mutating viral threats posed by endemic COVID-19 (vs. a control group). Setting: Survey respondents were administered the trials online. Participants: All adults aged 18 or over, residing in either the US (Trials 1, 3) or Rhode Island (specifically; Trials 2, 4), and who were members of a large, online, opt-in survey panel recruitment pool maintained by YouGov, were eligible for inclusion in this study. Interventions: Respondents were randomly assigned to read a short message promoting annual COVID-19 vaccine uptake (vs. a control group, shown an unrelated message). In Trials 1 and 2, messages either made an effort to (a) normalize COVID-19 as endemic (\u201cnormalization\u201d [NORM]), (b) both normalize and highlight the Long COVID health risks posed by endemic COVID-19 (\u201cnormalization + risk\u201d [NR]), or (c) a control message unrelated to vaccination. In Trials 3 and 4, respondents were randomly assigned to either read (a) the aforementioned \u201cNORM\u201d message, (b) a message \u201cde-normalizing\u201d (DENORM) COVID-19 as a constantly mutating viral risk, or (c) a study-wide control message. Outcomes & Measures: The primary outcome variable in this study measures respondents\u2019 self-reported intentions to receive an annual COVID-19 vaccine. The primary explanatory variable in our analyses is an indicator of experimental condition assignment, stratified by whether respondents (a) received a full COVID-19 vaccine sequence & at least one booster shot, (b) received some form of COVID-19 vaccination, but no boosters, or (c) are unvaccinated against COVID-19. Results: In Trials 1 and 2, we find that unvaccinated Rhode Islanders exposed to the NR messaging, but not NORM messaging, were significantly more likely to intend to receive an annual COVID-19 vaccine (NORM: B = 0.13, CI = -0.03, 0.30, p = 0.11; NR: B = 0.22, CI = 0.00, 0.44, p = 0.05). In Trials 3 and 4, we find that exposure to DENORM messaging, but not NORM messaging, is also associated with annual COVID-19 vaccine uptake among unvaccinated Rhode Islanders (NORM: B = 0.19, CI = -0.03, 0.41, p = 0.10; DENORM: B = 0.23, CI = 0.01, 0.44, p = 0.04). We detect no significant effects in either of our national samples, which post hoc analyses suggest might result from observed and unobserved differences in unvaccinated populations across Rhode Island and national samples. Conclusions: Our work suggests that messaging emphasizing both the endemic health risks (\u201cNR\u201d) and challenges of combating new COVID-19 variants (\u201cDENORM\u201d) may be effective at increasing annual COVID-19 vaccine uptake in unvaccinated populations, and suggest opportunities for future research regarding how differences in state public health contexts might moderate the effectiveness of COVID-19 vaccine communication.",

    "description": "Objective: This study examines educational heterogeneity in the impact of parental separation on educational attainment, considering the full sequence of childhood family structural changes. Background: Studies have consistently associated parental separation with lower socioeconomic achievement. However, the underlying causes remain unclear, possibly due to self-selection or continued instability in the family environment. Method: This study employs structural causal modeling and Bayesian logistic regression to investigate the causal effect of childhood family structural changes on adult educational attainment using Finnish full-population register data (n = 272,962), focusing on cohorts born in 1987\u20131991 and their family members. Results: A substantial portion of the 17-percentage-point disadvantage of children from separated families was due to the selection of families into separation and further structural changes. Separation effects followed a U-shaped pattern, with the largest negative effects among families in the middle of the educational gradient. Stepparents did not exert positive or negative effects, except for highly educated parents\u2019 children benefiting from stable stepfathers. Recurring family instability had the largest negative impact. Conclusion: The curvilinear relationship between parental and child education may partly explain the mixed results of previous studies. Implications: Given that recurring family instability was shown to be the most detrimental to children\u2019s educational attainment, low-threshold guidance and support to aspiring and existing blended families might have the largest impacts on children of separated parents.",

    "description": "The average lifespan has increased strongly in the past decades, but not everyone has benefited equally. Establishing the degree of intergenerational persistence of survival generates insights into broad inequalities between individuals and families in their likelihood to live to high ages. Using established register-type data for a region in Southern Sweden 1880-2015, we show that even before the rise of the modern social gradient in health in the 1960ies, mortality is lower among descendants from long-lived parents (top survivors of their birth cohort). This shared survival advantage between parents and children persists over time even after considering SES. Mortality among the descendants of top survivors is lower in lifestyle-related causes of death, suggesting that behavioral factors could be a significant factor in explaining the survival advantage, but also. Overall, we find that mortality concentrates in families in patterns that go beyond the influence of SES alone. Similarities between relatives in health and mortality therefore provide an important lens into inequalities in survival and health over time.",

    "description": "A quarter of a century has passed since the late Terry Crowley summed up the academic consensus that the creole language Bislama poses no immediate threat to any of Vanuatu\u2019s Indigenous languages. Does this remain true today? Since that time, evidence both quantitative and qualitative has been accumulating that suggests Bislama is indeed gaining ground at the expense of Vanuatu\u2019s Indigenous languages. In a targeted review of this evidence, this article brings together and assesses the insights of linguists, ethnographers, and others on the causal mechanisms that explain an ongoing shift towards Bislama. It thereby provides both a critical analysis of the current state of knowledge and a provisional causal framework for understanding current threats, predicting future threats and, potentially, intervening to prevent future threats. Language endangerment and extinction is a global issue with devastating implications for communities worldwide \u2013 one which Vanuatu, the world\u2019s most linguistically diverse country, has thus far remained resilient in the face of. However, this review of the available evidence warns that Bislama will continue to disrupt intergenerational transmission of Indigenous languages unless a suite of inter-related mechanisms can be counteracted.",

Qualitative research methods, including semi-structured interviews with the STI Hub program head, program review committee head, and focus group discussions with review committee members, were used in the evaluation of the research assessment process. The alignment and quality of the project proposals were determined by how well they addressed the STI Hub program\u2019s stated objectives. Analyzing the STI Hub's objectives helped develop 19 indicators essential to fulfill the program's goals. 200 proposals were evaluated to determine if they addressed these indicators, providing insights into the quality of submitted proposals and their alignment with the program goals. Our findings suggest that the alignment of proposals with project goals is not encouraging, highlighting the challenge of balancing publication-driven academic research with the need for immediate social impact and participatory research approaches in research proposal design. The research assessment process needs better formal guidelines, a structured assessment method, and transparency. The reputation of the institution and principal investigator, as well as the perspectives of review committee members, influence decision-making. The findings highlight the need for a better understanding of the STI Hub program\u2019s objectives among reviewers and a shift in academic attitudes to value various outcomes beyond journal publications and institutional reputation. The findings of this paper will help guide the design and implementation of future social impact initiatives by Indian STEM funding agencies.",

    "description": "Parental transfers of money and co-residence to young-adult children can serve as means of status reproduction. Yet, the relationship between inequality and socio-economic gaps in these forms of parental support has not been studied. Inequality may widen socio-economic differentials in monetary and co-residential transfers, potentially hindering social mobility. I test the association between income inequality and socio-economic divides in parental support to children aged 22\u201335 in the United States (U.S.), a context where the economic dependence of young adults has increased over decades of high or rising inequality. I link state-level inequality data to longitudinal data on 39,626 parent-child dyads from the Health and Retirement Study (1992\u20132018). Using state fixed-effects models I investigate how changes in income inequality within states relate to changes in wealth, income, and educational gradients in parental transfers over time. Socio-economic differences in the occurrence and amount of money transfers widen with inequality, as the probability of monetary support decreases among lower-class and lower-educated parents, while the amounts transferred increase among upper-class and higher-educated parents. Moreover, in times of higher inequality, co-residence is more strongly concentrated among lower-class, lower-educated parents. Previous research shows that receiving money improves labour and housing market outcomes, while co-residence may restrict economic opportunities among young adults from disadvantaged backgrounds. In light of this, my findings suggest that rising U.S. inequality may hinder social mobility by shifting the socio-economic distribution of intergenerational support.",

    "description": "Scholars have found that as the proportion of female workers in an occupation grows, wages generally decline. Yet, we know little about how this gender inequality intersects with other labor market inequalities. This study evaluates the feminization-wage relationship of an increasingly economically polarized post-2000\u00a0US labor market. First, I hypothesize that the negative effect of feminization on wages has diminished in high-skilled occupations due to the declining prejudice against (highly educated) women and increasing requirements for higher education, which functions as a form of social closure. Second, because of the increasing demand for \u201cpeople skills\u201d in higher-skilled occupations and their association with women, workers in higher-skilled occupations that require these skills may experience positive effects of feminization on wages. Not all people skills, however, are associated with women and similarly rewarded. Thus, I examine three people skills\u2014persuasion, managerial, and sociability\u2014that have different gender stereotypes. I test hypotheses using occupational-level fixed-effects models with individual-level data from the American Community Survey 2003\u20132019 (N\u00a0=\u00a015,996,526) and time-varying occupational-level data from the Occupational Information Network 2003\u20132019 (N\u00a0=\u00a0460). Results show that for workers in occupations requiring more than sixteen years of education, feminization corresponds with higher wages. Additionally, the positive feminization-wage relationship is larger in occupations with a high demand for a gender-neutral people skill, persuasion. This moderation effect is not found for sociability and managerial skills, which are associated with women and men, respectively. This study calls for greater attention to how labor market polarization has shaped gender inequality.",

In this article, I investigate how school attributes affect preferences and choice, which sheds light on the processes that maintain school segregation. To do so, I conduct a survey experiment that explores parental preferences and the tradeoffs inherent in the process of school selection using school profiles that resemble those available on widely used education data platforms. I find that parents hold the strongest positive preferences for learning opportunities and overall school achievement compared to other attributes, including school racial and socioeconomic composition. Additionally, though parents prefer schools that have higher equity rankings, highly equitable schools are less desirable to parents than schools with more status and learning opportunities. However, parents also hold independent racial and socioeconomic preferences and \u2014on average\u2014avoid schools with more students of color and low-income students. Furthermore, results suggest they are largely unwilling to make tradeoffs that would result in schools with higher fractions of students of color or low-income students.

    "description": "The salience of neighborhoods in shaping crime patterns is one of sociology\u2019s most robust areas of research. One way through which neighborhoods shape outcomes is through the creation and maintenance of social networks, patterns of interactions and relationships among neighborhood residents, organizations, groups, and institutions. This paper explores the relationship between network structures generated through acts of co-offending\u2014when two or more individuals engage in an alleged crime together\u2014and patterns of neighborhood gun violence and gun availability. Using arrest data from New York City, we create co-arrest networks between individuals arrested in the city between 2010 and 2015. We analyze these network patterns to, first, understand the overall structure of co-offending networks and, then, assess how they impact neighborhood levels of gun violence and gun availability. Results show that local and extra-local networks play a central role in predicting neighborhood levels of shootings: neighborhoods with a greater density of local ties have higher shootings rates, and neighborhoods that share social ties have similar rates of violence. In contrast, the network dynamics involved in gun recoveries are almost entirely local: co-offending patterns within neighborhoods are strongly associated with the level of gun recoveries, especially the clustering of co-offending networks indicative of groups. Contrary to previous research, spatial autocorrelation failed to predict either shootings or gun recoveries when demographic features were considered. Social-demographic characteristics seem to explain much of the observed spatial autocorrelation and the precise measurement of network properties might provide better measurements of the neighborhood dynamics involved in urban gun violence.",

However, questions remain about how psychological mechanisms play a role in the incorporation process. While some immigrants might internalize a sense of social alienation, others might be able to overcome the detrimental impact of historical and present-day exclusion and develop a psychological notion of belonging to US society. To test the role of a psychological mechanism in the incorporation process, I rely on national survey data from the 2016 Collaborative Multiracial Post-Election Survey and a novel survey experiment. By leveraging these data, I examine the determinants of perceptions of inclusion in the United States among Latinos. The findings present a mixed picture of incorporation. I find that as Latinos become more familiarized with the United States culturally and socially, they are more likely to develop a sense of belonging. However, both experiencing discrimination and perceiving that the in-group faces discrimination negatively shape Latinos\u2019 psychological sense of belongingness. Furthermore, receiving hostile messaging causes Latinos to feel less included in the US society.

Our results show a strong association between mother\u2019s gender attitudes and child\u2019s gender attitudes among both immigrants and natives, with no significant difference between the two groups. The persistence of beliefs grounded in family culture results in significantly higher levels of gender traditionalism among adolescent children of immigrants as compared to their native peers.

The increase in managerial representation was most prominent for women of color. Consistent with relational inequality theory, these findings suggest that women may find it easier to make claims for leave and for career advancement when both legal and organizational policies lend legitimacy to their claims. More broadly, this study points to the need to explicitly evaluate how policy impacts vary by organizational norms and commitments.",

    "description": "How do fathers adjust their working hours after the birth of their first child? Though the impact of childbirth on women\u2019s employment is well-established, less is known about its effect on fathers. We investigate this question in the Netherlands (2006\u20132017), a country characterized by high prevalence of part-time work. We focus on two contexts that might shape the extent to which first-time fathers reduce their working hours after childbirth: the household and the organization. For this purpose, we use detailed longitudinal register data. The results reveal that men\u2019s employment displays a high degree of stability around childbirth: even in the Dutch \u201cpart-time economy,\u201d the vast majority of fathers remain full-time employed. We do find substantial heterogeneity in labor market responses after childbirth. Fathers earning relatively less than their partner pre-childbirth are more likely to scale down their working hours. The organizational gender composition is also associated with work hours reductions following childbirth. Although we find that fathers\u2019 employment is contingent on both the household and organizational context, the substantial stability in men\u2019s labor supply remains an obstacle to a more equal division of (un)paid labor.",

    "description": "How do real-estate investors make decisions about where to purchase properties? In recent years, an increasing share of the market has gone to investors, making it critical that we understand the behaviors of these important actors. This study examines investment as a relational process. Through 74 interviews with real estate investors, as well as additional interviews with homeowners and renters in low- to middle-income neighborhoods in Baltimore, I find that strategic interactions and intimate relational work among professional and amateur investors are key to understanding how properties are sold. Professional investors cultivate bonds with new investors by identifying common goals and obstacles. They also use concealment strategies to sell homes, including: legal concealment, concealment through bundling, and concealment through brokers. Legal concealment involves using legal vehicles to transfer properties between owners. Concealment through bundling occurs when properties are bundled together to be sold in bulk. Finally, concealment through brokers entails finding brokers who can connect sellers to investors from other markets. These strategies obscure not only the nature of the relationship between buyers and sellers but also the quality of products being sold. The series of exchanges resemble how products are sold within direct-selling organizations and other predatory industries, which rely on a pyramid-like structure of sponsors and distributors. Furthermore, concealment strategies are more likely to happen in weaker markets and poorer neighborhoods where investor behavior is less constrained\u2014this suggests that concealment has potential to increase urban inequality.",

    "description": "Research on the economic assimilation of immigrants and their descendants has disproportionately focused on men. In this study, we examine the life-course employment and earnings trajectories of first- and second-generation women using a restricted-use dataset linking individual respondents of the Current Population Survey (CPS) to their tax earnings records. We compare the age-specific probability of employment and annual earnings of women of each immigrant generation by race and ethnicity from early to middle adulthood covering a span of 20\u00a0years. We consider alternative explanations for observed disparities including differences in the level of education and the timing and response to childbearing. Our analyses reveal distinct patterns across immigrant generations and ethnoracial groups. We find that first- and second-generation women are assimilating economically at a fast pace although significant ethnoracial differences remain. First-generation Hispanic women in particular experience low employment and earnings growth. Second-generation women have higher employment rates than later-generation Whites and avoid the dip in employment trajectories in early and middle adulthood experienced by the latter group. The higher employment rates of second-generation women cannot be fully explained by differences in educational attainment or the presence of young children.",

    "description": "This study investigates two concurrent trends across Europe and North America: the increasing instability of parental unions and men\u2019s rising contributions to household work. Because children have almost universally resided with their mothers and it is difficult for non-residential fathers to maintain any levels of care work, union dissolutions have potentially slowed societal increases in gender equality. A new family form\u201450/50 living arrangements\u2014has begun to challenge our understanding of the consequences of union dissolution. Since 50/50 residence requires fathers to take full care responsibility for the child half of the time\u2014something few partnered fathers do\u2014it may even push parents into a more egalitarian division of care work. We have studied care work using Swedish administrative data on parents\u2019 leave from work to care for a sick child. We have created a panel of leave-sharing for children aged 2\u201311, and use an event-study design to estimate the causal effect of dissolution on the sharing of sick-child leave. The results show that in parental unions dissolving today, the dissolution leads to an increase in fathers\u2019 share of sick-child leave. Whereas union dissolutions have for decades been slowing the gender revolution in Sweden, they are now accelerating it.",

    "description": "Popular explanations of inequality as the result of individual failings rather than structural processes are powerful cultural mechanisms that legitimize and reproduce inequality in the United States. How might individuals\u2019 experiences of downward or upward mobility shape the explanations they give? We argue that perceived experiences of economic mobility may not only shape how Americans understand economic inequality but may also impact their beliefs about social inequalities more broadly. Using proportionally representative survey data of 1110\u00a0U.S. residents, we find that those who perceive that they currently occupy a lower economic class than when they were growing up (i.e., they experienced subjective downward mobility) were more likely than class-stable individuals to reject individualistic explanations of economic inequality and embrace structural ones. By contrast, the upwardly mobile were more likely to reject structural explanations. We find that mobility is similarly related to the likelihood of giving individualistic or structural explanations for race and gender inequality as well. Downward mobility is also associated with greater support of redistributive policies related to economic as well as gender and race inequality. These findings suggest that economic mobility may influence popular explanations of inequality and support for redistributive policy not only related to class inequality but for multiple axes of inequality.",

    "description": "Given the dual crises of climate change and rising economic inequality, it is imperative to improve the synergy between climate mitigation and income inequality reduction. Domestic income inequality is linked to nations\u2019 carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions through multiple theorized pathways. Using a multidimensional framework, multiregional input\u2013output analysis, panel regression analysis, and a sample of 34 high-income nations from 2004 to 2015, I investigate the relationships between nations\u2019 income inequality and four components of CO2 emissions with distinct implications for climate change mitigation: (1) emissions generated by domestic-oriented supply chain activities; (2) emissions embodied in exports; (3) direct emissions from end-user activities; and (4) emissions embodied in imports. I theorize that income inequality is heterogeneously related to the four emission components via different pathways. Results show that the relationships vary across emission components, change over time, and differ between inequality measures. The Gini coefficient is generally less influential on CO2 emissions than the income share of the top 10%. Notably, the income share of the top 10% is negatively related to direct end-user emissions from 2009 to 2011 and positively related to emissions in exports from 2011 to 2015, indicating variations in pathways both across emission components and over time\u2014especially during and after the Great Recession. The findings underscore the multidimensionality in the income inequality-CO2 emissions relationship. Whether reducing income inequality can generate the co-benefit of emission abatement while avoiding a potential trade-off is a context-specific question that requires careful policy design and implementation.",

    "description": "Studies exploring the integration of European immigrants tend to find cultural gaps between Muslim children and their peers. While some scholars argue that parent-to-child transmission is a key mechanism underlying this pattern, others privilege extrafamilial explanations by pointing to differences in cultural values within Muslim households. In the present study, I argue that these mixed results stem from a tendency in the literature to analyze distinct components of personal culture in isolation from cognate dimensions. To address this shortcoming, I use multigroup latent class models to explore how a wide range of attitudes (tapping ethnocultural identity, gender norms, sexual liberalism, and perspectives on integration) are clustered together in disparate regions of the belief space, marking distinct cultural identities. Then, I fit a series of logistic regressions to map how these cultural identities are distributed among immigrant-origin samples in four European countries and transmitted across generational lines. Ultimately, I arrive at the following conclusion: while Muslim youth stand out from their peers vis-\u00e0-vis their cultural identity profiles, there is little evidence to suggest that this pattern is decisively shaped by parent-to-child transmission.",

Meanwhile, in affirming children\u2019s right to express their gender identity, those on the left treated gender identity as innate, an idea traditionally associated with conservatives, while saying little about sexism. These similarities, notwithstanding, we also found important differences between how these two groups discussed gender socialization.

Existing demographic literature has considered the impact of unemployment on parental coresidence but overlooked the potential influence of precarious employment. Yet, features of precarious employment might matter for young adults\u2019 residential arrangements. Our paper provides a theoretical framework linking precarious work to parental coresidence. Specifically, we outline three mechanisms that underlie this relationship: low pay, meager benefits, and short job tenure. Using longitudinal data from the National Longitudinal Survey of Youth from 2005 to 2017, we provide empirical support for our model. We found that precariously employed young adults are more likely than their peers in standard jobs to live with their parents. About a third of this effect can be accounted for by the three theorized mechanisms. Our research contributes to the growing literature demonstrating the impact of economic insecurity on the workplace and family, the two essential arenas of social life.",

    "description": "Understanding disparities in the rates at which men and women\u2019s wages grow over the life course is critical to explaining the gender pay gap. Using panel data from 2009 to 2019 for the United Kingdom, we examine how differences in the rates and types of job mobility of men and women\u2014with and without children\u2014influence the evolution of wages. We contrast the rates and wage returns associated with different types of job moves, including moving employer for family reason, moving for wage or career-related reasons, and changing jobs but remaining with the same employer. We find important gender and parenthood differences in the types of mobility experience, with mothers most likely to switch employers for family-related reasons and least likely to move for wage or career reasons, or to change jobs with the same employer. While job changes with the same employer and career related employer changes had large positive wage returns, changing employers for family-related reasons was associated with significant wage losses. We show that differences in job mobility between mothers and other workers are largest for young employees (under 30), the period over which wages also grow most rapidly in response to career related external, or internal, job moves. These mobility differences play an important role in explaining the rapid growth in the motherhood wage gap in the years after birth.",

The lack of definition and any grounding in cognitive theory makes identifying prehistoric symbols and symboling more art than science. A multiplicity of claims from the literature highlight the tendency to claim almost any form from any period of prehistory as symbolic. After the problem is defined, an alternative approach is proposed. The alternative suggests grounding symbols and symboling in contemporary cognitive theory; this would permit the construct to be operationalized as qualities potentially discernable in prehistoric material forms. A multi-level construct is also proposed, one that is not only capable of differentiating symbolic cognition as exhibited by the human species today from the presumably non-symbolic cognition of contemporary non-human primates but which is also able to differentiate both from the emergent symboling capacities of ancestral hominins.",

    "description": "Discrimination is one of the largest barriers that immigrants and racial/ethnic minorities face in contemporary society. Social scientists have developed and applied field experimental methods to detect the existence and prevalence of discrimination in various domains. In addition, researchers have utilized questionnaires to directly ask discrimination victims about their experiences and the frequency of discrimination they encounter. However, self-reports of discrimination may be biased due to judgment errors in attributing mistreatment to discrimination and intentional overreporting (vigilance) or underreporting (minimization) of discrimination. In this study, we propose a two-stage model that distinguishes between these judgment and reporting biases. We argue that vigilance and minimization stem from sensitivity concerns. We conducted a list experiment with African American respondents who asked about their experiences of employment and everyday discrimination. Comparing the list experiment and direct question estimates, we find no evidence of systematic underreporting or overreporting of employment discrimination. For everyday discrimination, we find overreporting concentrated among ideologically liberal African Americans. These results provide new insights into biases in self-reported discrimination and suggest researchers should be attentive to the conditions under which these biases arise.",

Multilevel generalized linear regression models showed that compared with mothers with no child incarceration, mothers of ever-incarcerated children were more likely to binge drink and consume more drinks when drinking (between-person effects). In contrast, following child incarceration, women consumed alcohol less frequently and were less likely to binge drink than they were prior to experiencing child incarceration (within-person effects).

    "link": "https://share.osf.io/preprint/E01D1-86B-50A",
    "description": "While partisan gerrymandering has been found to be widespread for Congressional redistricting in the United States, there exists little empirical research on legislative redistricting in other countries. We investigate the partisan bias of Japanese redistricting. Some scholars have argued that the prominent role played by the non-partisan commission leaves little room for partisan gerrymandering. Others have pointed out, however, that the Japanese redistricting process may be subject to political influence. The members of the redistricting commission must be appointed by the Prime Minister and be approved by the Diet. In addition, the commission invites the governors of all prefectures to provide their opinions regarding districting. We conduct a systematic empirical analysis to estimate the partisan bias of the 2022 Japanese Lower House redistricting plans. We apply a state-of-the-art redistricting simulation algorithm to generate a large number of alternative non-partisan redistricting plans. The sampled plans are representative of the population of plans and are consistent with the redistricting rules with which the commission must comply. By comparing the enacted plan with this non-partisan baseline, we quantify the extent to which the enacted plan favors a particular party. Unlike the traditional methods, our simulation approach accounts for political geography and redistricting rules specific to each prefecture. Our analysis shows that the Japanese redistricting process yields little partisan bias both at the prefecture and district levels.",

    "link": "https://share.osf.io/preprint/E01A4-F01-E01",
    "description": "Biodiversity declines are accelerating globally, impacting ecosystem functioning, with consequences for human health. Interactions with biodiversity can benefit human wellbeing, leading to avoided healthcare costs. However, existing research does not account for the species within ecological communities and their effect traits that elicit wellbeing (e.g. colours, sounds). Many species\u2019 effect traits are seasonal, and spatial variation in exposure to ecosystems by different sectors of society can lead to unequal opportunities to gain wellbeing. Here, we use a novel analytical approach to explore how the relationship between forest biodiversity and wellbeing fluctuates: (1) temporally, between different seasons, and (2) spatially, across the socioeconomic deprivation continuum of a human population at a national scale (England and Wales). Forest species\u2019 effect trait richness is spatially heterogeneous, particularly in autumn, spring, and summer. Broadleaf forests have greater species\u2019 effect trait richness than other categories of forest. Forests with higher species\u2019 effect trait richness, and forests that resulted in higher self-reported participant wellbeing, were in areas with the least socioeconomic deprivation. Forest creation/restoration and nature-health interventions must recognise this ecological and social diversity to ensure initiatives are equitable and socially just. Conserving biodiversity will therefore better deliver ecosystems that underpin healthier individuals and societies.",

We document new facts about the absolute and relative mobility in lifespan. On average across cohorts, 47% of men and 57 percent of women lived longer than their parents, though this varied across cohorts. Relative measures show higher mobility, with substantially less variation across time and subpopulations. The intergenerational correlation in lifespan (a measure of persistence rather than mobility) is about 0.09 for both sexes \u2013 this low correlation is observed across races, education groups, cohorts, and birth states. Finally, we document that the intergenerational persistence of lifespan is much smaller than the persistence in socio-economic status. Moreover, correlations in lifespan and in education are largely independent of each other, suggesting that mobility in well-being may be larger than measures of income alone suggest.",

    "description": "We know that maternal education benefits child health and well-being. In contexts where extended kin are important sources of social support, there may be additional benefits for children from increased education of their kin. We test the hypothesis that children benefit from having more educated kin using data from an innovative longitudinal project in two low-income communities in Nairobi, Kenya. Leveraging variation in kin members\u2019 exposure to a national policy to lower the cost of secondary school education to account for selection, we find not only an improvement in education levels of kin but also significant intergenerational benefits for children in their families through improved household food security and faster language acquisition. However, we find no evidence that exposure to educated kin improves the nutritional status of these children. The implications of our findings are profound, as they demonstrate the contemporaneous benefits of educational expansion as well as the longer-term effects on subsequent generations, prompting us to rethink the role of education in shaping the well-being of children in low-income communities.",

From a critical approach to the \"hybrid\" theories (which point to the fundamental psychobiological materiality of disorders while maintaining that socially constructed evaluative judgments underlie every statement about \"illness\"), I argue that the status of disorder given to a set of symptoms is always entangled in a social, cultural and political dimension, and is not a \"natural fact\", even though it is metaphysically dependent on psychobiological processes. This metaphysical dependence is not only consistent with a biopsychosocial model, but also better adheres to the research data, while allowing for a normative or social constructionist dimension that is consistent with emancipatory projects.",

We use data from the Family History of Incarceration Survey (FamHIS), a nationally representative survey of adults in the United States (n\u2009=\u20092,703) to conduct an expansive test of associations between direct (own) and indirect (family member) incarceration and trust in the state, civic participation, and community engagement.

We offer one of the first quantitative tests of this prediction while also examining if the theory applies to highly flexible online gig work. Using a U.S. sample of Amazon Mechanical Turk workers, we find that mismatches between preferred and actual schedules are common and increase with hours worked. As predicted, mismatches are especially prevalent among platform-dependent respondents, but group differences are only significant for the minority of respondents working more than 30 hours per week.

One of the goals of these organizations is to promote libertarian ideas in the academy. The authors show how, in contrast to other academic pipeline building, libertarian-leaning organizations fear that their perspectives encounter resistance in the progressive field of higher education. Therefore, to keep libertarian ideas alive, they pursue strategies to guarantee a supply of graduate students for eventual academic jobs and provide professors with relatively easy access to funding, granting them autonomy vis-\u00e0-vis their home institutions. This funding may be used in part for programs that specifically hire libertarian PhDs, which in turn provide young scholars with a step ladder into the academy. The authors call this set of strategies an \u201cidea pipeline.\u201d On the whole, these efforts are designed to make a career studying libertarian ideas more desirable and viable for those inclined toward these viewpoints and to ward off the demise of libertarian thought in the academy.",

The visualization allows an easy-to-grasp snapshot of marital pairings considering partners born in different countries, as well as the identification of their spatial patterns. In some countries, such as Colombia and Peru, most intermarriage occurs between natives and Venezuelans. Conversely, in Chile, Ecuador, and Uruguay, there is much wider heterogeneity in country-pair combinations. In Chile, no country-pair combination dominates, reflecting the more balanced nature of migration flows from a broader set of countries. Overall, the results aid the interpretation of trends and patterns in marriage across country lines by placing them within a comparative regional context. This is a flexible tool that could be easily adapted to multiple other countries within or outside of the region, to analyses over time, and to a heterogeneous array of couple-level characteristics.",

Structured Big Data allow us to estimate the contribution of women scientists to the growth of science by disciplines (N = STEMM 14 disciplines) and over time (1990-2023). A monolithic segment of STEMM science emerges from this research as divided between the disciplines in which the growth was powerfully driven by women \u2013 and the disciplines in which the role of women was marginal. There are four disciplines in which 50% of currently publishing scientists are women; and five disciplines in which more than 50% of currently young scientists are women. But there is also a cluster of four highly mathematized disciplines (MATH, COMP, PHYS, and ENG) in which the growth of science is only marginally driven by women. Digital traces left by scientists in their publications indexed in global datasets open two new dimensions in large-scale academic profession studies: time and gender. The growth of science in Europe was accompanied by growth in the number of women scientists, but with powerful cross-disciplinary and cross-generational differentiations. We examined the share of women scientists coming from ten different age cohorts for 32 European and four comparator countries (the USA, Canada, Australia, and Japan). Our study sample was N = 1,740,985 scientists (including 39.40% women scientists).

We theorize two mechanisms and test them using a unique multi-source dataset consisting of real job advertisements, a survey among recruiters issuing these job advertisements, and organization-level data (n = 1,859). Results from hierarchical linear models indicate that more feminine wording relates to a higher number and share of applications by women. Our research contributes to public administration research, theorizing why, structurally, women may apply less for some public sector jobs.

    "description": "Public employment services (PES) commonly apply profiling models to target labour market programs to jobseekers at risk of becoming long-term unemployed. Such allocation systems often codify institutional experiences in a set of profiling rules, whose predictive ability, however, is seldomly tested. We systematically evaluate the predictive performance of a rule-based profiling procedure currently implemented by the PES of Catalonia, Spain, in comparison to the performance of statistical models in predicting future long-term unemployment (LTU) episodes. Using comprehensive administrative data, we develop logit and machine learning models and evaluate their performance with respect to both discrimination and calibration. Compared to the current rule-based procedure of Catalonia, our machine learning models achieve greater discrimination ability and remarkable improvements in calibration. Particularly, our random forest model is able to accurately forecast LTU episodes and outperforms the rule-based model by offering robust predictions that perform well under stress tests. This paper presents the first performance comparison between a complex, currently implemented, rule-based approach and complex statistical profiling models. Our work illustrates the importance of assessing the calibration of profiling models and the potential of statistical tools to assist public employment offices in Spain.",

We find that the use of science in policy documents has featured a steady increase over the last 25 years, highlighting science\u2019s growing relevance in policymaking. However, this marked increase masks stark and systematic partisan differences in the amount, content, and character of science used in policy. Democratic-controlled congressional committees and left-leaning think tanks cite substantially more science, and more impactful science, compared to their Republican and right-leaning counterparts. Moreover, the two factions cite substantively different science, with only about 5% of scientific papers being cited by both parties, underscoring a strikingly low degree of bipartisan engagement with scientific literature. We find that the uncovered large partisan disparities are rather universal across time, scientific fields, policy institutions, and issue areas, and they are not simply driven by differing policy agendas. Probing potential mechanisms, we field an original survey of over 3,000 political elites and policymakers, finding substantial partisan differences in trust in scientists and scientific institutions, which potentially contribute to the observed disparities in science use. Overall, amidst rising political polarization and science\u2019s increasingly critical role in informing policy, this paper uncovers systematic partisan disparities in the use and trust of science, which may have wide-ranging implications for science and society at large.",

    "description": "Dochow-Sondershaus\nSociological Science October 18, 2024\n10.15195/v11.a35\n\n\n\n\n\nThis study reexamines the relationship between the coexistence of distinct ethno-cultural groups and social connectedness. Although previous research suggests a negative association between neighborhood-level ethnic diversity or ethnic minority shares and individual integration, alternative theoretical perspectives propose that integration can occur equally well in neighborhoods with distinct ethnic groups but may require more time. Moreover, the causal nature of the observed negative relationship is unclear due to potential confounding biases related to neighborhood selection. To address these issues, this study presents a framework for estimating the longitudinal effects of neighborhood ethnic composition on social ties with neighbors. The objective is to estimate the differences in neighborly contacts between individuals in low- and high-minority share neighborhoods, under a counterfactual scenario where all households stay in their neighborhood for the same period. The findings challenge previous research by showing that the ethnic composition does not impact the quality of neighborly contacts. In addition, residing in a neighborhood for five years significantly enhances social connectivity, regardless of ethnic composition. These results suggest that reduced cohesion in areas with higher minority presence may be due to other factors such as socioeconomic disadvantage and housing instability.",

In contrast with earlier research, we treat education in relative terms. We find that the tendency for fluidity to increase within class structures after World War II, rather than being the expression of a \u2018worldwide secular trend\u2019, was restricted to a distinctive historical period of rapid economic growth and class structural change. Furthermore, in accounting for this increasing fluidity, the role of education may easily be exaggerated. The weakening of the \u2018direct\u2019 OD association is of at least comparable importance to changes in the OE and ED associations. Consistently with the proposed theory, class structural change, insofar as it promotes greater upward mobility, would also appear to provide a favourable context for increasing fluidity. Where downward mobility increases, the growing motivation and the capacity of more advantaged parents to protect their children against d\u00e9classement constitutes a powerful source of resistance to change in endogenous mobility regimes.",

    "link": "https://share.osf.io/preprint/E0035-863-31E",
    "description": "Introduction Weight is the most common reason for being bullied at school - far more common than other targets for bullying such as ethnicity, religion or sexual orientation. Research suggests weight bias and stigma - including negative beliefs, attitudes, and discriminatory behaviours related to a person\u2019s weight - is prevalent in educational settings among both pupils and staff. Most schools have anti-bullying policies with best practice suggesting policies should explicitly identify forms of unacceptable behaviour, such as racism or homophobia. We conducted an audit of secondary schools in southwest England to determine if/how they mention weight-related bullying in their policies. Methods We obtained lists of all secondary mainstream state, private, and specialist schools in seven local authorities and downloaded anti-bullying policies from their websites. Policies were searched for key words related to weight and size. We also recorded whether policies mentioned appearance or other key targets for bullying, such as race, religion, sexuality etc. We obtained school level data including size, gender mix, academic performance and quality ratings. Results From 255 schools with an available bullying or behaviour policy, only 6.7% specifically mentioned weight-related bullying. Just under half (48.6%) mentioned bullying in relation to appearance. Bullying was most often mentioned in relation to race/ethnicity (94.5%), sexual orientation (93.3%), gender (85.9%), religion (84.9%), or gender identity (67.5%). Private schools (N=40) were more likely to mention weight-based bullying (17.5%) than mainstream state schools (N=148, 6.1%). No specialist schools, whether state (N=41) or private (N=26), mentioned bullying in their policies. There was no strong evidence that other school characteristics made a difference, but small numbers limited the power of these comparisons. Conclusion There is a significant mismatch between the prevalence of weight-related bullying in schools and its representation within school anti-bullying policies. Some types of school are more likely than others to mention weight-based bullying in their policies. We recommend that schools explicitly recognise weight-related bullying in their anti-bullying policies and explore how to support staff and pupil to take action.",

It also offers an estimate of how relevant published journal articles and books from five humanities fields are to society. By modeling two evaluation tasks involving many raters and documents, we estimate how various reviewer characteristics (such as their chauvinism and strictness) and document characteristics (such as their field and content) affect societal relevance ratings. We then compare the influence of both reviewer and document characteristics on these ratings and provide an estimate of the societal relevance of humanities research where the factors contributing to peer review unreliability are filtered out. Our results suggest that, even according to humanities scholars themselves, a substantial portion of published humanities research is not relevant to society at large. Furthermore, our results also suggest that when using peer review to decide whether a particular piece of research is societally relevant, the selection of reviewers plays a more significant role than the content of the research.",

    "description": "The relationship between income and voter turnout is crucial to understanding U.S. democracy. Previous research finds that richer people tend to vote at higher rates than lower-income people. But this research relies on survey data and is subject to response and social desirability bias, producing widely varying estimates of the size of the income-based turnout gap. Using data with official, geocoded, precinct election results for the entire nation, we examine how precinct-level income is associated with changes in voter turnout between the 2016 and 2020 elections. We find a dramatic income gradient in precinct voter turnout, and that this inequality became larger in 2020 compared to 2016. When comparing top decile precincts to bottom decile precincts (>$121k vs <$38k), we estimate a turnout gap of 17 percentage points in 2016 and 27 percentage points in 2020. These results are robust in regression analysis controlling for critical features and spatial dependence.",

    "description": "Managers of parks and protected areas estimate the number of people who visit the lands and waters they steward to protect natural resources, improve visitor experiences, and communicate the value of public lands. However, the practice of visitor estimation is complex, challenging, and the methods are highly varied. While researchers and practitioners have spent decades improving and testing visitor estimation methods, determining the best approach for a specific situation remains difficult. As new methods have emerged in recent years, the need to evaluate them in the context of existing methods has become apparent. However, there has been little synthesis of this knowledge. Beginning with a systematic literature review and concluding with a Delphi approach, we review trends and themes in the research to develop a synthesized decision tool to aid in the practice of estimating visitors. We find that the volume of publications and variety of methods present in the literature has increased in recent years. Additionally, some methods are more prevalent in peer-reviewed journals than agency manuals, suggesting the connection between research and practice could be improved. We also identify three themes in the literature: all methods have benefits and shortcomings; emerging technologies create viable data; and these novel data require calibration. We synthesize our findings in table that we call the comparability matrix, which distills 30 attributes about 18 visitor estimation methods into one decision tool. This tool is hosted in an interactive online format for practitioners and researchers. Overall, we found that this two-phase approach, a systematic literature review followed by a Delphi method, is effective for subjects such as visitor estimation that are vast in scope and diverse in application.",

    "description": "Over the past two decades, violence against land and environmental activists has been on the rise, besetting even stable democracies. Using a unique, fine-grained data set on social conflict events in Peru and exogenous variation in world mineral prices, I document a strong link between local mineral rents and violent state repression of socioenvironmental protests in a democratic institutional setting. I show that the increase in the use of excessive force cannot be explained by changes in protester behavior. Empirical findings highlight the role of local authorities: the election of a pro-mining mayor is associated with a higher prevalence of state repression and corruption in the constituency. The legal and democratic accountability of local authorities is, however, found to be limited. The reported increase in corruption does not translate into more investigations against pro-mining mayors for corruption offenses nor are reelection results of incumbents found to be negatively affected by state violence against protesters. Finally, I show that violent state repression is successful in forestalling conflict resolution agreements that acknowledge protesters\u2019 demands.",

We propose a new comprehensive approach to measure the notion of SOS for a whole country. We leverage population-scale social network data from administrative registers to measure the size and social composition of five social contexts: families, households, neighborhoods, workplaces, and schools. We link this SOS at the individual level to survey-sourced personal network data on intergroup social ties. We showcase the potential of this population-scale measurement approach through data linkage by studying how the probability that Dutch natives have a social tie with an immigrant varies depending on the presence of immigrants and immigrant descendants in their SOS. We reflect on the advantages and limitations of our approach by documenting the data linkage process in detail and discussing the longitudinal and network nature of the data.",

    "description": "This work analyzes data obtained through a public request in 2021 of the highest academic level and gender in the career of CONICET support staff, which are scientific personnel in charge of a wide variety of highly qualified tasks such as: responsible of: equipment, techniques and laboratories, as well as administrative. There are other types of hiring this role in science, which are not contemplated in this analysis, such as: Article 9, contracted, outsourced personnel, dependent on universities with functions in CONICET, among other possible still unidentified. It was determined that there is a balanced composition of personnel from the undergraduate, graduate and postgraduate studies levels. By incorporating the gender variable, it can be seen that at the undergraduate and graduate training levels (non-university tertiary, intermediate and basic) are masculinized, while at the postgraduate training levels are feminized. In the analysis of the distribution of CPA personnel by career, we can see that there are more personnel in the Professional category: 1864 people vs 951, and that it is balanced in gender but this is not the same for the Technical career. Analyzing the Technical and Professional careers separately, it was found that there are people with a high level of training retained in the Technical category, a situation that affects women more than men. It can also be seen that in the Professional category, an analogous process occurs, in which the people who access this category with a level of training less than a bachelor's degree are mostly men, which confirms that there is greater pressure of training for women. In this work, this is not considered to be a strict demonstration of \u201coverqualification\u201d or \u201cunderqualification,\u201d since for this it is necessary to investigate more about the nature of the tasks they perform, how the bureaucratic incorporation and promotion mechanisms influence them, as well as the subjectivities put into play in the interpretation of which tasks are Technical and which are Professional.

Students with the very lowest and highest academic potential are the least affected by neighbourhood disadvantage, while those with below average\u2014but not at the lowest end\u2014are most strongly affected. Moreover, while girls are less affected than boys, and children from less educated and affluent families are more affected by neighbourhood disadvantage than their more privileged peers, the effects of these observed moderators are considerably smaller than the heterogeneity observed as a function of academic proneness.

    "title": "The Feasibility of National Inference Under the NSCAW IV L-State Sample Design",
    "link": "https://share.osf.io/preprint/E01D2-E88-572",
    "description": "The purpose of this Feasibility Analysis Study (FAS) was to evaluate methods for producing valid national estimates under the National Survey of Child and Adolescent Well-being (NSCAW) IV sample design. The NSCAW IV design is a stratified two-stage, unequal probability design that restricts the sample to within L purposively selected states, where L is a number between 8 and 12. (L = 10 was assumed for most the analyses in this document). The design is fully consistent with the NSCAW IV\u2019s primary objective (i.e., to provide detailed, precise state-level estimates for the L key states selected for the survey). However, an important secondary objective is to provide for valid national estimates, even though the sample design itself is not nationally representative. The FAS was conducted to determine whether the NSCAW IV L-state design could achieve this secondary objective. FAS confirmed that national estimates are indeed feasible. This report provides a summary of the FAS results and offers detailed, statistical evidence as to the NSCAW IV L-state design\u2019s ability to produce valid national inferences. State estimates can be produced from the NSCAW IV design by applying classical survey estimation techniques; however, national estimation requires nonprobability or so-called quasi-random estimation and modeling techniques. The FAS investigated two such estimation approaches: quasi-randomization weighting (QRW) and superpopulation modeling (SPM). Data from prior NSCAW cohorts\u2014NSCAW I and II\u2014were analyzed to simulate the NSCAW IV design. Fortunately, the NSCAW I and II designs are quite similar to what is proposed for NSCAW IV in that they both include a purposive selection of states\u2014L = 8, in total. The key difference between their designs and NSCAW IV\u2019s design is that the two prior surveys also included a random sample the \u201cremainder\u201d stratum (i.e., the combination of states that were not purposively selected). This remainder stratum provided for the unbiased national estimation in NSCAW I and II without the needed for nonprobability estimation approaches. However, the remainder stratum was initially ignored in application of the QRW and SPM to NSCAW I and II states to simulate the NSCAW IV design. Later in the analysis, the remainder stratum provided a mechanism to assessing the biases in the QRW and SPM national estimates. This was critical in order for the FAS analysis speculate on the potential bias risks for NSCAW IV national estimates using the sample estimation approaches. As the results in the report convincingly show, both the QRW and SPM approaches are capable of producing valid national estimates from the L-state design envisioned for NSCAW IV. QRW is recommended for the estimating the means of the vast majority of questionnaire characteristics; however, in situations where QRW may fail to produce accurate results, the SPM approach can then be implemented to produce more accurate results. One drawback of SPM is that it requires more effort and a higher level of statistical expertise to implement. The research reported in this document initially addresses the question of whether the QRW method can be feasibly applied to the NSCAW IV data to obtain valid national inferences based on a small number (8 \u2264 L \u2264 12) of purposively selected sample of states. Variations of QRW were applied to the NSCAW I eight-state sample and then, using the combination of the state and remainder stratum samples, the quality of the QRW national estimates was evaluated by comparing them to the full sample, unbiased national estimates. A number of key quality indicators were analyzed for national estimates related to 26 NSCAW characteristics\u201423 variables that overlap with the NCANDS data and three Child Behavior Check List (CBCL) characteristics from the survey questionnaire. Four types of estimates based solely on the eight-state data were computed: (1) unweighted estimates, (2) estimates based on the unadjusted NSCAW weights, (3) estimates derived from Method 1 weighting, and (4) estimates derived from Method 2 weighting. Estimates (1) and (2) were computed primarily to gain insight around the degree to which approaches (3) and (4) affect the bias of the unweighted and unadjusted eight-state estimates. Finally, the NSCAW I full sample estimates were computed, which provided the \u201cgold-standard\u201d estimates used to evaluate the quality of estimates (1) through (4) for national inference. Because the NSCAW IV design will use three domains\u2014the eight NSCAW I domains were collapsed to create the three NSCAW IV domains and the quality analysis was repeated for these \u201cad hoc\u201d domains. The NSCAW I QRW analyses demonstrated the success of these methods for extend inference from the NSCAW IV purposively selected state sample to the national level. Although some bias could remain in the estimates after weighting, the biases were significantly reduced from their unweighted counterparts for the vast majority of estimates. For substantive characteristics such as the CBCL variables, the biases in the QRW estimates were slightly larger but still acceptable for many research purposes. The results for the NSCAW I analysis were essentially confirmed using NSCAW II data: both data sets produced very similar results. SPM offers an alternative to QRW for creating national estimates from the L-state design. Because it incorporates specific covariates that are the most highly correlated with the outcome variable, it can achieve much greater estimation accuracy than is possible with the more general QRW methodology. A key distinction between SPM and the QRW is that, although the latter can be applied to any outcome variable, SPM must be tailored to each specific outcome variable of interest; i.e., each questionnaire variable represents a dependent variable in its own customized model. Nevertheless, for questionnaire variables where the QRW estimates have, or are suspected to have, unacceptably large biases, SPM offers a less biased alternative and can be used to produce higher quality inferences. The SPM analyses used the eight-state strata to project national estimates and then evaluated those estimates by comparing them to the corresponding national sample estimates that served as the gold standard. The results showed that, at least for the variables considered from NSCAW I and II, SPM produces excellent results, with very small biases in most instances. Based on these results, we believe the SPM approach is quite feasible for the NSCAW IV L-state design. Thus, its use is recommended for NSCAW IV, particularly in situations where QRW estimates are shown or suspected to be unacceptably biased.",

We used the ROAD database, managed by the ISSN International Centre, as a reference database which indexes 62,701 OA active resources (as of May 2024). Among the 62,701 active resources indexed in the ROAD database, the Web of Science indexes 6,157 journals, while Scopus indexes 7,351, and OpenAlex indexes 34,217. A striking observation is the presence of 25,658 OA journals exclusively in OpenAlex, whereas only 182 journals are exclusively present in WoS and 373 in Scopus. The geographical analysis focusses on two levels: continents and countries. As for disciplinary comparison, we use the ten disciplinary levels of the ROAD database. Moreover, our findings reveal a striking similarity in OA journal coverage between WoS and Scopus. However, while OpenAlex offers better inclusivity and indexing, it is not without biases. WoS and Scopus predictably favor journals from Europe, North America and Oceania. Although OpenAlex presents a much more balanced indexing, certain regions and countries remain relatively underrepresented. Typically, Africa is proportionally as under-represented in OpenAlex as it is in WoS, and some emerging countries are proportionally less represented in OpenAlex than in WoS and Scopus. These results underscore a marked similarity in OA journal indexing between WoS and Scopus, while OpenAlex aligns more closely with the distribution observed in the ROAD database, although it also exhibits some representational biases.",

    "description": "The population of Seoul had exploded from 1 million to 2.45 million in 7 years right after the end of the Korean War (from 1953 to 1960). Many parts of Seoul were converted into slum areas and aimless urbanisation lowered the quality of life in the Seoul metropolitan area. Pupils were excluded from education due to the lack of school infrastructure while citizens were exposed to crime and unemployment. In the middle of the population crisis, the metropolitan government of Seoul and the central government of South Korea paid attention to the potential of Gangnam as one of the candidate regions for the expansion of the Seoul metropolitan area. This review presents how Gangnam has transformed from an \u201cempty land\u201d to the \u201csymbol of wealth\u201d in the history of the Gangnam development and the expansion of the Seoul metropolitan area. The initial development plan tried to solve immediate housing problems derived from the lack of urban space and facility. After 20 years of the intensive development, Gangnam has transformed from a poor countryside region into the new economic centre and financial hub. Gangnam has become a symbol of wealth in South Korea where citizens and private companies would like to reside. On the other hand, many evictees lost their home and disappeared as nameless citizens behind the scenes of the development. The Gangnam-style development, the expertise of urban development acquired in Gangnam, can be thoroughly studied and transferred to other regions in South Korea and developing countries in the world, thus establishing Gangnam as a model case of metropolitan area expansion.

We argue that autocratic leaders are strategic actors who take preemptive action against potentially disloyal elites, rather than risking a coup attempt being realized. Using structural coup risk as a lower estimate of a leader's own perception of coup risk, we find that it significantly contributes to the prediction of minister removals. Contrasting its effect to that of failed coup attempts, we find that it substantially improves predictive performance across a number of metrics. Our findings contribute to nascent research on government stability and autocratic leader survival.",

    "description": "Objective: This study identifies the prevalence of sandwich care, and describes demographic, socioeconomic, health, and care characteristics of sandwich carers compared with other care groups in the UK. Background: Delayed childbearing and increasing care needs mean that parenting young children may increasingly coincide with the need to provide adult care, leading to so-called \u2018sandwich care\u2019, but little is known about sandwich carers in the UK. Method: Using eleven waves of the UK Household Longitudinal Study (2009-2020), a large, nationally representative household panel survey in the United Kingdom, five care groups were derived based on information regarding provision of adult care and living with children aged under age 16 (N=81,057). The prevalence of these groups were shown across waves, then waves were pooled and multinomial regression models were used to show age-adjusted differences in demographic, socioeconomic, health and care characteristics across the five care groups. Results: 2% of the UK adult population provide sandwich care . Parents caring for someone in the generation above were generally employed in professional/managerial occupations and cared less intensively outside the household while parents caring for a disabled child or partner were disadvantaged in terms of education and income, and tended to care intensively inside the household. Conclusion: It is important to recognise circumstances of care groups are heterogenous when designing policies and practice to support family carers.",

    "description": "This article develops an analytical and methodological field guide for analyzing the practices and politics of machine learning. Drawing on science and technology studies (STS), it seeks to move beyond the opacity/transparency dichotomy that often characterizes discussions of algorithmic systems. In doing this, the article hones in on actors\u2019 mundane practices of constructing machine learners, and develops an analytical stance based on four empirical moments: feature extraction, vectorization, clustering, and data drift. By making visible actors\u2019 work, tinkering, and negotiations involved in these processes, the article aims to demystify the supposed magic of machine learning. This approach allows us to ask: How do actors decide what constitutes a good machine learner? How are things, people, and phenomena translated into the mathematical worlds of machine learning? Through ethnographic attention to these questions, we can begin to grapple with the practices and politics of machine learning in earnest. Thus, the article contributes to ongoing discussions about the societal implications of AI by providing analytical and methodological tools for understanding how the politics of machine learning is assembled in practice.",

    "description": "Researchers have long relied on United States Customs and Border Protection (CBP) apprehension data as a proxy for undocumented migration, yet the last time their validity was assessed was in 1995. Significant changes in the composition of migrants and border crossings since then raise questions about their continued validity. In this research note, I provide an updated analysis using two independent data sources: the 2018 Guatemalan Census and annual estimates of undocumented Guatemalan arrivals to the United States from The Center for Migration Studies (CMS). Using descriptive and regression analyses, findings show a close alignment between apprehensions, household migrations reported in the Guatemalan census, and Guatemalan arrival estimates. Together, these results indicate that apprehensions remain a reliable indicator of migration flow despite recent changes in migration dynamics along the southern U.S. border.",

    "description": "Spatial mobility plays a crucial role in shaping social stratification processes. While previous research focused on adult workers\u2019 monetary returns from commuting or relocating, early career gains in occupational status may be more significant from a life course perspective. We examine whether spatial mobility yields status returns for labor market entrants and, if so, how such returns might be stratified by young people\u2019s local opportunity structures and their level of schooling. We use longitudinal data from the German National Educational Panel Study merged with fine-grained regional information and focus on transitions from school to Vocational Education and Training (VET). As a novel approach to address the methodological challenge of self-selection into spatial mobility, we propose incorporating young people\u2019s occupational aspirations into the regression analysis. We show that mobile young people are more likely to get higher-status VET positions. Yet, being spatially mobile only pays off if young people commute or move away from structurally weak regions and for those with higher levels of schooling who are already privileged in status attainment. We conclude that young people can potentially overcome regional disadvantages through spatial mobility, while spatial mobility also tends to widen the gap in status attainment between educational groups.",

    "description": "This study investigates the dynamics and factors affecting immigrant residential segregation in Japan between 2000 and 2020, a period marked by Japan's emergence as a global immigrant destination. Using restricted-access census microdata, I examined the segregation of the 12 largest immigrant groups to the Japanese majority and among each other. I then assessed the relationship between dissimilarity and factors affecting integration using pooled linear regressions and individual location attainment models. My findings reveal that all immigrant groups exhibit high residential segregation from the Japanese majority and notable pairwise segregation. There is a general trend of spatial assimilation that higher levels of socioeconomic factors predict less segregation, while Brazilians and Peruvians, the earliest contemporary immigrant group who arrived in Japan as ethnic descendants, demonstrate a pronounced tendency towards place stratification. These observations provide support for both spatial assimilation and place stratification theory in the Japanese context. Moreover, there is a strong trend of self-segregation among highly skilled elite, particularly Western immigrants from the Japanese majority and peer immigrants. The results provide support for this dichotomy in segregation trends, underlining the integration challenges for minority groups in global new destinations and the pronounced self-segregation among elite skilled minorities.",

On the other hand, it is still often defined by a few strident critiques more than a decade ago, the focus of which were pXRF users, not the instruments. There were three themes in those critiques: perceived weaknesses in (1) research design, (2) element quantification, and (3) publishing, especially as it relates to data evaluation. Recently, Johnson et al. (2024) sought to address the third critique, by both surveying the literature and proposing a checklist of 18 variables that, they argue, should be published to \u201cresult in better science\u201d from pXRF users.

Here, we demonstrate how singular value decomposition\u2014an existing mathematical decomposition technique\u2014can be used to summarize and understand variation among mortality schedules from multiple populations. We explain how singular value decomposition can be used to (a) extract key mortality age patterns from a set of mortality schedules; and (b) quantify the relative importance of these age patterns for the various mortality schedules included in the set. We demonstrate this method by decomposing variation in the mortality schedules of US states, showing that (1) most of the variation in 2019 was due to differences in young-adult mortality, and that (2) different US states achieved the same high level of life expectancy at birth with fundamentally different mortality profiles. The singular value decomposition approach complements existing pairwise decomposition methods for describing and summarizing mortality differences across populations, and we discuss further potential areas of application.",

    "description": "In prevailing Western media discourses, older women\u2019s anger and resistance are often portrayed as a result of the physical and mental decline inherently associated with ageing. These representations reinforce the image of older women as vulnerable subjects who are weak, frail and excluded from society. This article proposes an alternative reading of expressions of unruliness related to ageing, gender and sexuality in Western media and visual culture through the lens of Halberstam\u2019s concept of gaga feminism. The aim is to explore how gaga feminism\u2019s aesthetics of collapse, creative anarchy and experimentation can construct new constellations of ageing, sexuality and gender. We have conducted a critical, contextualised reading of a selection of cultural artefacts that express various elements of a gaga aesthetic. Our analysis reflects on the three central principles of gaga, specifically (1) new forms of social relations and sexualities, (2) more fluid articulations of gender and (3) creative anarchy; and on what they can mean for an anti-ageist project in media and visual culture. In this way, this article offers insights into the creative and unruly ways in which ageism, heteronormativity and sexism can be subverted and destabilised in representations.",

This study compares the relevance of biological parent and stepparent involvement for children\u2019s well-being, including stepmother and stepfather families, while accounting for children\u2019s residence. Multiple regression analyses were conducted using the New Families in the Netherlands (NFN) survey, large-scale data collected among divorced and separated parents with minor children (2015/16; N = 3218). Involvement in routine activities was not associated with children\u2019s well-being. Biological parent and stepparent involvement in interactive activities was positively associated with well-being, except when biological parent involvement was (too) frequent. Children, on average, benefited equally from the interactive involvement of both parent types. Biological parent involvement had a stronger positive association with child well-being than stepparent involvement only when involvement was rare. Yet, when involvement was (overly) frequent, stepparent involvement was related to better well-being, with the opposite effect for biological parents. These findings are consistent between stepmother and stepfather families. This study, overall, indicates that interactive activities are important to the well-being of most children, whether undertaken by biological parents or stepparents.",

    "description": "Perceived discrimination is the feeling of belonging to a group targeted by discrimination. This paper examines three mechanisms identified in the literature that contribute to this perception among migrants: exposure to actual discrimination through social contacts, language proficiency and awareness, and unmet aspirations. Using a subset of the European Social Survey dataset, which includes approximately 45,000 first- and second-generation migrants, we analyse the effects of individual characteristics (migrant generation, language skills, social contacts, education, and training) and contextual characteristics (integration policies) on perceived discrimination. Our findings reveal the existence of an \"Integration Paradox,\" particularly for Muslim migrants. More integrated Muslim migrants, especially those from the second generation, report higher levels of perceived discrimination. We also find that the integration setting does not have a direct effect but moderates the relationship between migrant generation and perceived discrimination. Notably, second-generation Muslim migrants feel most discriminated against in countries with \"intermediate\" levels of integration policies, suggesting short-term unintended consequences of such policies. These findings underscore the importance of paying close attention to this group in the present and near future, especially given their steadily increasing presence in European societies.",

    "description": "In the Arctic, seasonal variation in the accessibility of the land, sea ice, and open waters influences which resources can be harvested safely and efficiently. Climate stressors are also increasingly affecting access to subsistence resources. Within Inuit communities, people differ in their involvement with subsistence activities, but little is know about how engagement in the cash economy (time and money available) and other socio-economic factors shape the food production choices of Inuit harvesters, and their ability to adapt to rapid ecological change. We analyse 281 foraging trips involving 23 Inuit harvesters from Kangiqsujuaq, Nunavik, using a Bayesian approach modeling both patch choice and within-patch success. Gender and income predict Inuit harvest strategies: while men, especially men from low-income households, often visit patches with a relatively low success probability, women and high-income hunters generally have a higher propensity to choose low-risk patches. Inland hunting, marine hunting, and fishing differ in the required equipment and effort, and hunters may have to shift their subsistence activities if certain patches become less profitable or less safe due to high costs of transportation or climate change (e.g., navigate larger areas inland instead of targeting seals on the sea ice). Our finding that household income predicts patch choice suggests that Inuit differ in their capacity to maintain access to country foods depending on their status in the wage economy.",

    "description": "A growing demographic literature examines the impacts of climatic variability and environmental shocks on human population dynamics, focusing largely on migration, morbidity, and mortality. Considerably less is known about the effects of environmental changes on fertility despite plausible theoretical and empirical reasons to expect such impacts. We contribute new evidence to this emerging literature by examining the relationship between exposure to flooding and fertility in Bangladesh. We link birth records (n = 617,081 person-years) from the Demographic and Health Survey (DHS) with satellite-derived measures of flooding from 2001 through 2018 and fit regression models to measure the effects of flood exposures on the probability of live births in subsequent years. To explore hypothesized causal pathways, we also construct panels of women\u2019s entry into first marriage (n = 52,293 person-years) and mortality among under-5 children (n = 331,153 person-years), and fit comparable regression models of these fertility correlates. Overall, flooding has highly uneven effects on fertility across the target population. We detect statistically and substantively meaningful flood-related increases in childbearing among less-educated and higher-parity women; but find evidence of flood-related declines in fertility among childless women and those in urban areas. Among all populations, these flood effects operate with a two-year lag. The analyses suggest that flood-related declines in marriage among urban women may explain reductions in fertility among this population. However, they otherwise provide little systematic evidence that marriage and child mortality mediate the links between flood exposures and fertility.",

Second, volatility does not decrease asset value while volatility of a lognormal distribution actually raises value. We thus argue that asset risk drives volatility, but not vice versa, implying that asset risk cannot be diversified away. Third, support to MAR appears to arise from a confusion between asset value and wealth utility: the law of diminishing marginal utility supports that volatility reduces the latter. The above causes explain why CAPM and Fama-French models have long been struggling to price asset volatilities. To address these challenges, we delineate expected asset value (which asset risk impacts without a distribution) and volatility (which does not affect the former while following a quasi-normal distribution we proposed). We show that equity price is the present value of a future payment spanning over firm maturity, which has no face value of common payments. As options is a combination of debt and equity, various assets\u2019 risk thus is rooted in a future payment\u2019 risk that approaches zero as maturity approaches zero (Nie, 2024a). We show that our asset risk, captured as risk premium, solves issues that have long been challenging agency theories, and redefines firm misvaluation theories.",

    "description": "The International Institute of Intellectual Cooperation (IIIC) was an international organisation established post-World War I, aimed to foster intellectual relations for global peace. As this institution becomes centenary, the digitisation of archival records has democratised access, sparking renewed scholar interest and eventually enabling new research avenues. Here, we examine two letter collections from IIIC\u2019s digitised funds, focusing on administrative and artistic/literary matters. By analysing recognisable sender-receiver pairs and their geographical origins, we construct networks revealing intricate international relationships. Notably, the community structures and roles differ between administrative and literary exchanges, suggesting distinct communication dynamics. Administrative matters depict a more egalitarian distribution. In contrast, relevant literary correspondents include Western European countries exclusively, reflecting the prominence of certain geocultural areas as well as potential geopolitical influence attempts, challenging the established historical narratives on centres and peripheries, inviting a revaluation of the IIIC\u2019s geographical organisation and intellectual cooperation during the interwar period.",

Recent scholarship is attempting to explore how different places and people are involved in the development of AI. This chapter builds on this scholarship to extend the debate around the hidden and opaque networks of sub- contracting practices for AI training. In particular, it examines the ways in which lead firms develop their AI systems by tapping into a complex network of suppliers, platforms, and human workers doing data work in some of the most marginalised parts of the world. The chapter shows that despite their touted nature as autonomous machines (i.e. without human control), AI is dependent on a global army of human labour performing a wide variety of data enrichment tasks. It then concludes by discussing implications of this data work on workers and places where AI gets trained.",

    "description": "Current approaches to engaging First Nations peoples in urban policy and planning are placing an unreasonable and unsustainable burden, especially on Traditional Custodians, new AHURI research finds. A change of relationship with Traditional Custodians and a rethinking of current engagement approaches could create a more responsible process. The research, \u2018Voicing First Nations Country, culture and community in urban policy\u2019, undertaken for AHURI by researchers from University of Sydney, RMIT University and University of NSW, examines the relationship of First Nations peoples in Australia to urban policy, and is designed to centre First Nations sovereignty, authority, knowledge, governance and agency as the starting point toward a more responsible relationship. Urban places, from large metropolitan areas to small towns in regional areas, are sites of intensive dispossession at the same time as being dense networks of community and ongoing cultural practice and connection. Nevertheless, urbanisation and the density of population settlement, private property and the miasma of legislation, policy and regulation imposed on Country hasn\u2019t destroyed First Nations Traditional Custodians connection to ancestral lands or their cultural obligations and rights to lands and waters. Governments are asking local planners and developers to consult with First Nation Traditional Custodians with some level of engagement. This has the effect of intensifying pressure on Custodians, with short timeframes and often unrealistic expectations imposed upon First Nations communities. Urban policy planning can be a tool for healing and repair between First Nations people and the broader Australian community. Engagement can be used to create new opportunities\u2014but current engagement approaches require rethinking and need to include building longer term relationships, long before a project requires engagement. Building and sustaining relationships and creating new processes and models must be supported with resources structures that are secure, ongoing and transcend piecemeal project-by-project funding.",

    "description": "This study explores whether procedurally just interactions between police and citizens enhance perceptions of police legitimacy in high-crime environments. We conducted a representative in-person survey across five major Colombian cities, covering about 7 million residents. The survey included a vignette experiment presenting respondents with one of four scenarios that varied police officer respectfulness\u2014characterized by clear communication of intentions\u2014and neutrality. Our findings reveal that respectful behavior from officers significantly boosts citizens' perceptions of police legitimacy. In contrast, neutrality alone, or even combined with respect, does not affect these perceptions. This suggests that respect is an important component of procedural justice in fostering police legitimacy, while the standalone importance of neutrality is questionable. Policymakers should note that emphasizing respectful interactions in police training can foster greater trust and cooperation within communities, aiding effective crime prevention and community policing efforts. Conversely, focusing solely on neutrality without ensuring respect may be insufficient, possibly due to citizens' biases toward specific stereotypes.",

    "description": "The distribution of research funding in academia is not equitable. There is a disproportionate allocation of funding benefitting an academic elite, whereas researchers from different marginalized groups have fewer opportunities to obtain funding. This can be changed by exploring alternative ways to allocate research funding. One way in which funding agencies have tried to stimulate research based on more equitable principles is the sandpit model. A sandpit is an intensive, multi-day brainstorming event during which different consortia are formed. These consortia are subsequently required to compete to obtain research funding. Very little research is done on how and whether such models work. There is some evidence that, under the right circumstances, models such as the sandpit can stimulate multidisciplinary research with societal impact. However, no attention has been given to the question whether these models contribute to equity within the academic world, or whether they sustain the inequities that are prominent. Within this paper, we critically examine possible mechanisms of exclusion through an in-depth study of a sandpit event, and we discuss which groups are disadvantaged by these events. Furthermore, we suggest ways in which sandpits and other funding initiatives can be made more equitable.",

However, we observed small to insignificant correlations between social media and messaging use, suggesting that the two categories \u2013 or sub-ecologies \u2013 are not strongly displacing or driving one another. Both social media and messaging apps were used consistently across space \u2013 though individuals averaged slightly more time on social media at home and messaging on foot.

To test our method, we collected original data in Tanganyika Province of the Democratic Republic of the Congo, a setting where reliable estimates of death rates are in high demand. Qualitative fieldwork suggested testing two different types of personal networks as the basis for death rate estimates: deaths among immediate neighbors and deaths among kin. We benchmarked our network estimates against a standard retrospective household mortality survey, which estimated a crude death rate nearly twice as high as our network-based methods. Given both methods are equally plausible, our findings underscore the need for further validation and development of both methods.",

    "description": "From calls to ban critical race theory to concerns about \u201cwoke culture,\u201d many Americans have mobilized to oppose antiracist claims and activism. Here, we propose that this opposition represents a distinct racial ideology among white Americans, profoundly shaping contemporary racial politics. We explore opposition to antiracism (or anti-antiracism) across five studies (two surveys and three experiments; total N=7,486). First, we find evidence that anti-antiracism is a distinct and prevalent racial ideology unto itself. We find anti-antiracism is internally coherent, highly stable over time, resistant to change in the face of counter-evidence, and distinct from\u2014though strongly associated with\u2014anti-Black prejudice. Next, we find evidence for the strong influence of anti-antiracism on the politics of white Americans: anti-antiracism is prevalent among whites, particularly Republicans, is a powerful predictor of several policy positions\u2014including being more strongly related to whites\u2019 support for Donald Trump than political ideology, socioeconomic variables, or several measures of explicit and implicit racial prejudice\u2014and predicts whites\u2019 responses to policy frames and political candidates in two pre-registered survey-experiments.

    "description": "Partisan animosity has been on the rise around the world and has been linked to such consequential outcomes as political violence. It is especially prevalent in online social interactions and frequently results in derogatory discourse. The authors develop a novel theoretical account of the network-structural antecedents of derogatory language use. In polarized online groups, they hypothesize that the greater the structural similarity between two individuals, the less will be their likelihood of using derogatory language with one another. They further argue that this relationship will be moderated by the degree of group polarization. Using a node embedding algorithm (i.e., node2vec) to derive an omnibus measure of interpersonal structural similarity, they find support for the theory using a dataset that encompasses more than 25 million comments made by over 1.7 million users in six polarized communities on Reddit. They discuss implications for research on partisan animosity, group polarization, the measurement of structural similarity, and the interplay of structure and culture.",

    "description": "Man and his wealth are catalysts for consumption of resources that we refer to as commodities. While this was understood since Engel, who first tabulated these expenditures, the nature of the demand function itself remained unresolved. Economics of consumption is redefined here in terms of its basic variables, income and expenditures, in a self-consistent universal hierarchy. The analyses so far did not take into account a correction for income though the preference for consumption is primarily hierarchical. Using data from National Sample Survey Organization of India, we demonstrate the universality of the rectangular hyperbola that defines the consumption for each commodity on the basis of residual income, by deducting expenditures of higher preference based on elasticity coefficients. Since different commodities show a hierarchy of hyperbolic functions, both in the rate at which the saturation is achieved as well as the saturation itself, we needed a commodity for which the critical time constant (accounting for the hyperbolic function) is known and invariant, viz., educational expenditures. The year-wise income classes of parents that reflect the relevant expenditures for education of Brazilian children, compiled earlier by Costa Ribiero, uniquely show a constant hyperbolic function for all the years when analyzed in terms of \u2018residual income\u2019.

Using the National Library and Archives of Quebec (BAnQ) as a case study, it explores the interplay between practices and interpretations of what constitutes data culture within this public cultural institution. Rather than approaching data culture as an entirely new set of dispositions that organizations need to develop, I propose understanding it as a contested field of meanings. This field brings together heterogeneous elements\u2014some grounded in long-established professional practices, others emerging in response to new digital demands\u2014where divergent logics of action and values collide. Rooted in critical data studies, this paper offers empirical insights into the power dynamics within data cultures, conceptualized as complex arrangements of meanings, material apparatuses, and social practices. It identifies key factors that shape data culture at the BAnQ: organizational structures, professional values, institutional goals (such as artifact documentation, public accessibility, and performance optimization), governmental requirements, and data tools and ideologies. The formation and evolution of data culture at the BAnQ appear to be a dynamic process that requires aligning new practices with existing frameworks of meaning, while also exposing tensions and resistance among differing interpretations. From this perspective, data culture emerges as an arena of debate, leading to genuine disagreements over the data practices required to fulfill the BAnQ\u2019s broader mission. As the institution navigates the challenges of datafication, its approach to data governance becomes pivotal in balancing public service goals with the imperatives of data innovation.",

We conducted a survey of 505 California farmers and ranchers affected by wildfires between 2017 and 2023. Main findings show that wildfires\u2019 impacts on producers are extensive and range from mild to catastrophic, with both short and long-term repercussions, regardless of their exposure level. Producers play a central role in community emergency wildfire risk response and management by reducing fuel loads, creating defensible space, and leveraging their fire management expertise for themselves and their neighbors. Many producers lack a robust financial safety net, particularly among vulnerable populations, pointing to the need to increase access to recovery resources including insurance and disaster assistance programs. We find an urgent need for policy reforms, improved support, targeted extension programs, and integrated coordination mechanisms. Producers are our overlooked allies in building widespread wildfire resilience. Enhanced collaborative efforts among producers, fire professionals, and agricultural support organizations are thus imperative to co-create and implement strategies that ensure the long-term sustainability and economic viability of California\u2019s agricultural communities.",

    "description": ": Just as a car is only activated by the ignition key with the driver's energy, modern society is sustained by the energy present in each individual. In a universe dominated by the second law of thermodynamics, entropy - the inherent tendency towards disorder - is an inescapable constant. However, life, in its essence, challenges this tendency, maintaining order and complexity through free energy. This energy, especially human energy, is not only the vital force that sustains biological processes but is also the primary energy source that fuels the complex structures and operations of contemporary societies. For 95% of humanity's historical time, human energy was channeled very differently than it is today. It was primarily directed towards group cohesion, life sustenance, and maintaining balance with the surrounding environment. Life in small cohesive groups allowed for a balanced use of energy, resisting entropic forces. However, with the transition to post-agricultural societies, there was a drastic shift in how this energy is utilized. The demands of modern society, with its emphasis on production, transportation, marketing, and consumption, require an unprecedented amount of human energy. This energy is extracted from individuals. This essay seeks to explore this dynamic, questioning the diversion of human energy from its primary purpose and the need to realign our societies to recognize the intrinsic value of human energy in the form of labor. In an entropic universe, where disorder is the norm, human energy is our greatest defense against chaos. Therefore, it is imperative that we recognize its centrality in our lives and societies.

Despite these generally robust patterns, however, variability in the results from laboratory experiments examining competence-based discrimination leaves questions about the specific diagnoses that elicit the discrimination and gender differences in the discriminatory behavior.

As with other laboratory studies, we examine if and how a teammate\u2019s psychiatric diagnosis affects participants\u2019 willingness to accept the teammate\u2019s problem-solving suggestions in a two-person task group. But we go beyond the previous studies by crossing the teammate gender with participant gender and by exploring the robustness in our results by examining the moderating role of numerous participant attributes (e.g., education, social desirability, parents\u2019 education, age, political liberalism, three gender ideology scales, trust in others). We find that participants discriminate against teammates with both types of psychiatric diagnoses but not against teammates with the nonpsychiatric health problem and that this pattern is highly robust: The processes are almost entirely unrelated to teammate gender and participant attributes, including participant gender. Together, these results suggest that both schizophrenia and depression elicit competence-based discrimination, that these processes differ very little by participants\u2019 demographic and attitudinal attributes, and that the status beliefs underlying this discrimination may be fairly uniform.",

    "description": "After nearly half a century, domestic workers were again tabled on the agenda of the International Labour Conference in 2008. Three short years later, Conference delegates voted to establish the International Labour Organization\u2019s Convention on Domestic Work (C189). This paper builds on the insight that the campaign to push for C189 was taken up by a feminist \u201cvelvet triangle\u201d. These networks are usually comprised of women in social movements, femocrats and academics. The informality of these alliances is due, in part, to the gendered marginality of an issue area, allowing for improvisation and agile coalitions. The paper traces the origins of this triangle to bottom-up calls to develop measurement methodologies to make women\u2019s labour \u201cvisible\u201d in the UN Conferences on Women, and later in discussions about the informal economy. It then examines the relations among femocrats in the ILO, academics, and the global trade unions in one important element of the campaign \u2013 mobilising statistics on domestic workers worldwide. The paper demonstrates how the production and mobilisation of statistical estimates were crucial in making the sector more tractable. It attends to the under-explored effects of the \u201cpower of cognitive resources\u201d in the literature. Finally, the article shows that the explicitly political project of the women\u2019s movements yielded not only a normative labour instrument, but advances in different fields of study. This case shows that the production of scientific knowledge, while still an overwhelmingly elite endeavour, need not always cater to elite demands.",

    "description": "This visualization examines regional convergence in housework time in Germany, focusing on age- and cohort-sensitive differences between East and West since reunification. Using data from the German Time Use Study (1991/1992\u20132022), the analysis shows that once substantial regional disparities in housework time have largely diminished for both men and women across cohorts. This trend aligns with other developments, such as convergence in educational opportunities, labor market behavior, and gender role attitudes, which may be linked to changes in unpaid work time.",

    "link": "https://share.osf.io/preprint/E0224-0C8-C66",
    "description": "This text is the third and final installment of an extensive investigation into the concept of irony in the early thought of S\u00f8ren Kierkegaard. Over the course of this series, the study has examined the Danish Golden Age's cultural and intellectual context, along with the influence of German Romanticism and Hegelian philosophy on Kierkegaard's development. In this concluding work, irony is explored as a key philosophical tool in On the Concept of Irony with Constant Reference to Socrates (1841). The analysis argues that irony is not merely a tool for destruction but a dialectical means that leads to authentic subjectivity. The paper explores the philosophical influences that shaped Kierkegaard's concept of irony, particularly his critique of Romantic irony for its nihilistic tendencies. Building on these influences, Kierkegaard formulates the idea of \"controlled irony,\" which allows individuals to confront life's contradictions without losing connection to ethical reality. This study delves into how Kierkegaard redefines irony as a necessary process for existential fulfillment, linking its roots in Socratic irony to his critique of Romanticism, ultimately proposing irony as a means to achieve an authentic and ethical life.",

    "link": "https://share.osf.io/preprint/E0049-F9F-79D",
    "description": "In the absence of high-quality data, death tolls are often estimated using ad hoc methods. One understudied class of methods, which we term the growth rate discontinuity method (GRDM), estimates the size of death tolls by projecting between pre- and post-crisis population estimates with crude growth rates and then subtracting the projected values. Despite its simplicity, this method is the source of prominent death toll estimates for the Black Death, the 1918 influenza pandemic, the Great Chinese Famine, and the Rwandan genocide, among others. In this article, we review the use and validity of GRDM. Using statistical simulation and comparisons to the results of well-validated demographic methods, we assess the accuracy, precision, and biases of this method for estimating mortality in absolute and relative terms. We find that GRDM requires precision in its inputs to an extent rarely possible in contexts of interest. If one has sufficient data to specify GRDM well, one can likely also use a more reliable method; if one lacks that data, the estimates produced by the method are so sensitive to data quality issues and other assumptions that they cannot be considered informative. These findings create problems for existing demographic and econometric work that has used GRDM to analyze mortality crises for which demographic data is scarce.",

The Covid-19 pandemic has tested the resilience and adaptability of liberal-constitutional democracies globally. In the European Union (EU) and its Member States, different policy responses with different impacts on constitutional democracy could be observed and have been analysed in several REGROUP research papers. This policy paper will use these findings to provide six best practices and key takeaways for policymakers, legal practitioners, and scholars. Therefore, the policy paper analyses the impact of the Covid-19 pandemic on liberal constitutional democracies by assessing the responses of EU Member States and formulates actionable policy recommendations. The goal is to enhance the EU\u2019s effectiveness in responding to future crises, strengthen its resilience, and preserve the EU\u2019s liberal-constitutional democracy.",

    "description": "Introducci\u00f3n: Las redes sociales han generado una importante transformaci\u00f3n en la manera en que se transmite y comparte informaci\u00f3n, sin embargo, esto ha llevado a una gran problem\u00e1tica: la desinformaci\u00f3n, en especial acerca de temas relacionados con salud y nutrici\u00f3n. Este problema se ha propagado ampliamente en redes sociales debido a la falta de estrategias regulatorias y a la proliferaci\u00f3n de influenciadores no cualificados que se establecen como l\u00edderes de informaci\u00f3n Objetivos: Analizar la responsabilidad \u00e9tica de los profesionales de la salud en la difusi\u00f3n de informaci\u00f3n nutricional en redes sociales, resaltando la importancia de garantizar que dicha informaci\u00f3n est\u00e9 cient\u00edficamente respaldada. M\u00e9todos: Se realiz\u00f3 un ensayo acad\u00e9mico a partir de la revisi\u00f3n de literatura en bases de datos cient\u00edficas como PubMed, NCBI, BMC Medical Ethics y JMIR, entre otras, basada en estudios recientes sobre la difusi\u00f3n de desinformaci\u00f3n nutricional en redes y los principios \u00e9ticos que gu\u00edan a los profesionales de la salud en la comunicaci\u00f3n digital. Resultados: El an\u00e1lisis de la bibliograf\u00eda seleccionada revel\u00f3 que existe una gran presencia de individuos en redes sociales que comparten datos err\u00f3neos no verificables, y que se establecen como autoridades en temas relacionados con nutrici\u00f3n, sin poseer las acreditaciones necesarias, reforzando su credibilidad ante el p\u00fablico mediante t\u00e9cnicas de comunicaci\u00f3n novedosas, marketing y publicidad, y compartiendo informaci\u00f3n falsa en forma de dietas y consejos nutricionales que es recibida ampliamente por un p\u00fablico altamente influenciable. Esta conducta representa un riesgo significativo para la poblaci\u00f3n y la salud p\u00fablica, ya que la falta de verificaci\u00f3n de la informaci\u00f3n y la ausencia de pensamiento cr\u00edtico acerca de lo que se publica en las diversas plataformas ha llevado a la propagaci\u00f3n de pr\u00e1cticas nutricionales nocivas. Conclusiones: El ensayo concluye que los profesionales de la salud no solo tienen la responsabilidad \u00e9tica de difundir informaci\u00f3n cient\u00edficamente respaldada, sino que tambi\u00e9n tienen el deber de denunciar activamente la desinformaci\u00f3n que encuentren en redes sociales. La formaci\u00f3n en competencias digitales y pensamiento cr\u00edtico son cruciales para que lograr enfrentar eficazmente la desinformaci\u00f3n y educar al p\u00fablico. _____________",

    "description": "Should a set of hypothetical interventions eliminate the Black-White gap in malleable factors such as schooling, how much racial disparity in subsequent youth development would be reduced and how much would remain? To address this question, a causal decomposition analysis must credibly identify the causal impact of intervening on the malleable factors. However, major confounders such as parental SES are intermediate outcomes of systemic racism experienced over generations that place Black households and communities at a great disadvantage. For this reason, an intervention that attempts to eliminate the Black-White gap in schooling within levels of parental SES or other endogenous confounders has two major problems: (1) Such an attempt is infeasible when only one but not both racial groups are present within some extreme levels of parental SES. (2) Even if both groups are present within every level of parental SES, the attempt would nonetheless fail to eliminate the marginal Black-White gap in schooling due to the endogeneity of parental SES. We propose a novel solution that replaces the original scale of an endogenous confounder with a scale preserving one\u2019s within-group relative standing. A semiparametric weighting strategy then emulates the counterfactual outcome of an equity-oriented intervention. Our analysis of the NLSY 1997 data reveals real-world implications of the methodological dilemma posed by endogenous confounding.",

    "link": "https://share.osf.io/preprint/E006C-358-216",
    "description": "How does stakeholder participation in natural resource management change when conservation rules are grounded in near real-time data? Recognition of our rapidly changing climate and recent technological advances have facilitated the increased feasibility of the \u201cdynamic management\u201d of natural resources, which promises to align the spatiotemporal scales of management with ecological variability and resource use. Drawing on Kelty\u2019s (2020) concept of \u201ccontributory autonomy,\u201d this article offers a critical comparison of how participation is conceived of in the more established context of static conservation areas and planning versus the emergent field of dynamic management. A systematic review of the dynamic ocean management literature reveals a varied, but shallow engagement with the topic of stakeholder participation in that context. Whereas static management regimes are governed by intuitive and readily contestable maps, dynamic management is governed by models and data flows. Overall, the decision-making stakeholder of participatory mapping processes under static management is displaced by the stakeholder conceived as an \u201cend user\u201d of a dynamic management product. Yet, these shifts also open up potential points of contestation, which may pattern the future theory and practice of participation in dynamic management: counterdata, countermodeling, and data chokepoints. Beyond the empirical focus on oceans, this article contributes to broader conversations about the political stakes of environmental data, and algorithmic and artificial intelligence-driven natural resource conservation by considering how possibilities for participation are foreclosed, enabled, and reconstituted by new spatiotemporal and technological conditions.",

    "link": "https://share.osf.io/preprint/E0211-85F-D57",
    "description": "The province of Almer\u00eda in Spain is home to one of the largest concentrations of greenhouse agriculture in the world, covering over 32,000 hectares and producing more than 3.8 million tonnes of fruits and vegetables largely for export across Europe. Migrant agricultural workers here face precarious working and living conditions, which profoundly shape their relationships with food, ingredients, and cooking. The food system in this region is deeply entwined with global food consumption practices, extractivist supply chains, and irregular migration patterns. While much research has focused on the economic and environmental impacts of industrial agriculture, less attention has been given to how migrant workers\u2019 interactions with food reflect their social and cultural identities amidst these challenges. This study protocol outlines our aims and methods to explore these relationships, examining how migration and labour conditions influence food-related practices, and how these practices serve as means of cultural preservation, adaptation, and survival. Using a collaborative photo-elicitation methodology, we will work with migrant workers in Almer\u00eda to document their relationship with food through photography and interviews. Participants will be asked to capture images of their daily food practices over a 7-10 day period.

    "description": "Antisemitism has been rising for decades and worsened following the events of Oct 7, 2023. Although anecdotal evidence suggests that these trends extend into the US medical community, quantitative data have been lacking. To address this gap, we quantitated publications about antisemitism, analyzed social media posts from the accounts of 220,405 healthcare professionals, and disseminated a survey to members of Jewish medical associations. Publications and social media posts about antisemitism rose >5-fold, while posts promoting antisemitic stereotypes increased 2-4-fold. Most Jewish-identifying medical students and professionals (75.4%) reported exposure to antisemitism. Together, our results suggest that antisemitism is escalating within the US healthcare community.",

This paper presents the Tellus Calendar, a reform proposal grounded in metric principles inspired by the French Republican Calendar (FRC) but adapted to modern needs. By introducing a 12-month calendar with 10-day weeks and 30-day months, this proposal aims to achieve uniformity and predictability without displacing familiar seasonal cycles or cultural milestones. The Tellus Calendar offers an achievable balance between innovation and tradition, providing a perennial and globally viable alternative to our current system. Beyond structural improvements, the Tellus Calendar also promises enhanced efficiency in financial, academic, and social planning, simplifying long-term scheduling and fostering a more synchronised global society.",

    "description": "Ideology is frequently discussed as an important factor in maintaining the current capitalist economic order. To date, however, descriptions of long-term changes in capitalist ideology remain mostly qualitative. By using computational methods (word embeddings) on two large corpora of historical English texts (Google books & Corpus of Historical American English), this article is the first to provide quantitative data on such long-term changes between 1850 and 1999. It thus tests three prominent claims found in the existing literature and presents the following main findings: 1) The rise of neoliberalism is represented by a weaking discourse on economic regulation rather than by an increase in liberal discourse. 2) Meritocratic values are promoted most intensely in times of high inequality. 3) Intrinsic work motivation becomes more important over time, but extrinsic motivation remains dominant. These findings have various theoretical and practical implications.",

    "title": "Why do endemic livestock diseases persist? An interdisciplinary perspective.",
    "link": "https://share.osf.io/preprint/E01BC-9ED-1CE",
    "description": "Epidemiology is a field in which the aim is to identify the characteristics, causes and means of control of conditions that exist outside of physiological norms. For both infectious and non-infectious diseases, genetic, physiological, environmental, and behavioural factors can all influence the risk of acquiring disease, meaning that, despite differences in how they manifest, the problems and solutions associated with them can be remarkably similar. Epidemiology has always made use of ideas and techniques from other disciplines that help to achieve its aims, but typically takes a \u201ctoolbox\u201d approach, bringing in data, techniques and methods and insights that support epidemiologists to solve problems they already perceive as important. However, it is not necessarily sufficient for tackling \u201cwicked\u201d disease problems which may require long-term investments in interdisciplinary teams, with members working together in finding shared solutions to disease, and to educate and be educated in different disciplinary perspectives on the problem. For endemic diseases in particular, while methods of control and even eradication do exist it is often the case that they are not put into practice. Here, we address two exemplar endemic diseases in the context of farming in England: Bovine Viral Diarrhoea (BVD) in cows, and lameness in cattle and sheep. These diseases were selected because of their significance to UK livestock agriculture and their contrasting epidemiologies. Both are highly impactful and have been recognised for at least half a century as among the biggest threats to livestock health, welfare and productivity in England. In both cases, while historically embedded social factors have been central to their persistence, the reluctance of social scientists and and historians to issue normative guidelines means that they are less able to offer explicit advice to policy, hindering the adoption of broader interdisciplinary perspectives. To fill some of the gaps in that advice, here we suggest approaches to bringing a broad range of observers to bear on them. First, while BVD and lameness are both quite well understood and \u2018educating\u2019 farmers (as often advocated in studies informed by \u2018theory of planned behaviour approaches\u2019) by treating veterinary perspectives as normative is unlikely to be universally successful. Farmers\u2019 perspectives often have their own logics that are informed by individual circumstances and past experiences which veterinarians and other advisors can fail to appreciate. Second, we note that both farmers and consumers have shown they value health in terms of impacts on welfare and production, however \u2018welfare\u2019, like \u2018health\u2019 is likely to be perceived differently by farmers compared to veterinarians, and this requires further study. Finally, the new policy contexts of animal health as public good presents important opportunities. Beyond these general lessons, there are also particular issues for each disease. For BVD, with the uneven distribution of costs and benefits, differences in farming perspectives make it highly unlikely that the industry will come together around a voluntary BVD eradication scheme that rests on testing and trading controls. and much can be learned from the countries that are already on that journey or have reached their destination. By contrast, for lameness, where risk-factors are multi-factorial and usually highly localized, universal approaches make little sense. Here, industry-led schemes make more sense because lameness control (unlike BVD) is not a zero-sum game. Moreover, because lameness is pathologically and epidemiologically complex, and rooted in farming systems that can be difficult to change substantially, eradication is extremely hard if not impossible to achieve so local measures make more sense. In both cases, greater understanding of farmer priorities can help to identify ways to make farmers and other farm-based actors such as family members and farm workers more amenable to scientific advances, by identifying (ahead of time) potential barriers. Animal disease problems inevitably involve a complex presentation of natural and behavioural factors. By working together, we have been better placed to understand how those pieces can fit together.",

Since openly revealing an intention to leave the organization may result in unfavorable working conditions or discomfort, respondents may be reluctant to report their intentions when asked directly. In February 2023, we conducted an online survey of 719 public sector employees, which included both a direct question about turnover intention and a list experiment. We find that 15.07% of respondents reported turnover intention in the list experiment, compared to 7.15% in the direct question, suggesting underreporting. We also find that the difference between these two estimates is greater for female respondents than for male respondents, implying a higher desirability bias among female civil servants.",

    "link": "https://share.osf.io/preprint/E0065-E45-D19",
    "description": "The concept of the Vienna School of Comparative Musicology, later renamed as Vienna School of Comparative-Systematic Musicology, plays an important role in received historical accounts of musicology in twentieth-century Austria (used as shorthand for the various political entities to which the territory of post-World War II Austria belonged). The concept was developed in the second half of the twentieth century, most notably by Walter Graf (1903\u20131982) and Franz F\u00f6dermayr (1933\u20132020), both former professors of comparative(-systematic) musicology at the University of Vienna. Proponents of this concept point to Richard Wallaschek (1860\u20131917) and especially Robert Lach (1874\u20131958) as the founders of the school and emphasize the synthetic character of the Vienna School, combining approaches from the natural sciences, social sciences, and humanities. The Vienna School of Comparative-Systematic Musicology can be analyzed as a historiographical narrative, as a coherent story of how a particular branch of Austrian musicology developed over time, mostly as a kind of \u201cWhig history.\u201d This paper examines key aspects of this narrative: Who contributed to its construction? How did the narrative evolve over time? Which scholars, institutions, and types of research are part of the narrative? Which are excluded or appear only as supporting characters? How is this particular form of comparative-systematic musicology represented in relation to other forms and schools of (comparative) musicology? What discursive function(s) did this narrative serve? How was it received? And to what extent has it remained relevant in the present?",

    "description": "This study examines the dynamics of social disasters in the context of anti-Asian hate speech and counter-hate speech on social media during the COVID-19 pandemic. Using the COVID-HATE dataset (n = 2,491,405 tweets posted January 15, 2020 to March 26, 2021) , we analyze racial framing contests between movements and counter-movements. Through a mixed-methods approach, we find that: (1) the WHO's pandemic declaration triggered a significant increase in anti-Asian hate tweets, with counter-hate tweets emerging in response; (2) hate frames deployed racial projects characterizing Asians as public health and national security threats, while counter-frames either directly challenged these characterizations or bypassed them to focus on systemic racism; and (3) hate and counter-hate movements often \"spoke past\" each other rather than engaging in direct frame-counterframe dynamics as prevailing theories would predict. Counter-movements did not consistently produce opposing frames for each hate frame but rather developed independent messaging focused on combating racism itself. This study advances our understanding of how both hate and resistance operate through racial projects, with implications for theories of social movements, political communication, and racial formation.",

    "description": "Climate risks are growing. Research is increasingly important to inform the design of risk-management strategies. Assessing such strategies necessarily brings values into research. But the values assumed within research (often only implicitly) may not align with those of stakeholders and decision makers. These misalignments are often invisible to researchers and can severely limit research relevance or lead to inappropriate policy advice. Aligning strategy assessments with stakeholders' values requires a holistic approach to research design that is oriented around those values from the start. Integrating values into research in this way requires collaboration with stakeholders, integration across disciplines, and attention to all aspects of research design. Here we describe and demonstrate a qualitative conceptual tool called a values-informed mental model (ViMM) to support such values-centered research design. ViMMs map stakeholders' values onto a conceptual model of a study system to visualize the intersection of those values with coupled natural-human system dynamics. Through this mapping, ViMMs integrate inputs from diverse collaborators to support the design of research that assesses risk-management strategies in light of stakeholders' values. We define a visual language for ViMMs, describe accompanying practices and workflows, and present an illustrative application to the case of flood-risk management in a small community along the Susquehanna river in the Northeast United States.",

We compare cognitive-based interventions, such as activating social norms, with affective-based interventions that anthropomorphise air conditioners to evoke empathy. Intervention effectiveness is tested across three studies: a traditional survey experiment (to measure the manipulation of target constructs), two ecologically enhanced survey experiments (measuring behaviour intentions), and a field experiment measuring air conditioner use indirectly using wireless temperature sensors. Results indicate that interventions leveraging social norms and anthropomorphism, specifically those evoking negative emotions like exhaustion and anger, significantly influence air conditioner use. Enhanced survey formats cannot replace field experiments to assess an intervention\u2019s impact on behaviour.

We explored how different personas and experimental framings affect these AI agents' altruistic behavior in dictator games and compared their behaviors within the same LLM family, across various families, and with human behaviors. Our findings reveal substantial variations and inconsistencies among LLMs and notable differences compared to human behaviors. Merely assigning a human-like identity to LLMs does not produce human-like behaviors. Despite being trained on extensive human-generated data, these AI agents cannot accurately predict human decisions. LLM agents are not able to capture the internal processes of human decision-making, and their alignment with human behavior is highly variable and dependent on specific model architectures and prompt formulations; even worse, such dependence does not follow a clear pattern.",

    "link": "https://share.osf.io/preprint/E00D3-988-C41",
    "description": "In the hotel industry, the management of room temperatures plays a crucial role in both environmental impact and energy costs. Small changes, such as reducing heating by 1\u00b0C, can save around 6% on electricity. Despite the significant impact, there is a notable scarcity of interventions aimed at promoting sustainable air conditioner use among guests. Most pro-environmental behaviour-change interventions in tourism focus on environmental messaging and negative appeals, with mixed effectiveness. Positive emotions like amusement (humour) and self-transcendent emotions (compassion) have been largely overlooked but have shown potential in other research contexts. The current series of studies assesses the comparative effectiveness of messages designed to trigger humour, compassion, and environmental beliefs on sustainable air conditioner use. In Study 1, we develop and evaluate four alternative messages for each theoretical construct. We use the most effective message for each construct (e.g., the most amusing humour message) in Studies 2 and 3. Study 2 serves as a manipulation check to ensure the messages effectively triggered the intended theoretical constructs. It also assesses behavioural intentions and emotional reactions. Study 3 tests the impact of the interventions on real behaviour in a quasi-experimental field study. Study 2 shows that each message effectively strengthens its respective theoretical construct (e.g., the environmental message strengthened environmental beliefs). The field study demonstrates that all three messages, along with a basic behaviour instruction message, increase sustainable air conditioner use. The humour message had an advantage over the others, being positively perceived by participants and not causing negative reactions. Therefore, framing sustainable air conditioner use instructions humorously appears to be a promising strategy in the hotel context. While our humour message is tailored to the Australian winter context, future research should explore the applicability of humour-based interventions in diverse cultural and climate settings to enhance sustainable air conditioner practices globally.",

    "description": "Statistical discrimination theory suggests that discrimination arises when gatekeepers lack individual-level information and therefore draw on their knowledge on the group-level. According to this perspective, the policy solution is straight forward: provide gatekeepers with accurate individual-level information and discrimination will cease. Grades are important signals to students about academic ability and influence future educational choices. Previous studies find that teachers exhibit negative grading bias against boys, racialized minority students, and low-SES students so these groups receive signals about lower academic potential than merited. In this study, we test whether grading bias stems from statistical discrimination. First, we leverage a natural experiment in which teachers were given information from standardized tests and see whether this change mitigates grading bias. We further test this mechanism by analyzing the role of the performance of a given social background group at the same school the year prior. We find substantial grading bias but conclude that statistical discrimination is not likely to play a major role.",

In a factorial survey experiment, 578 participants rated the moral acceptability of agents performing a task (e.g., cancer diagnostics). We find that using AI is judged less morally acceptable than employing human agents. AI used in high-status organizations is judged more morally acceptable than in low-status organizations. No differences were found between computer programs and AI. Neither anthropomorphic nor gender framing had an effect.

It focuses on whether partners can achieve an adequate living standard without relying on family ties, and how the costs of children shape poverty risk within these scenarios. Using cross-sectional EU-SILC data (2016\u20132019) on 30,150 coresidential couples from Austria, France, Spain, and Sweden, I use linear probability models (LPM) to estimate household and individual poverty risks among partners with/out children, by education, gender and country. The results indicate that poverty risks vary by gender, income pooling scenario and country. While partners bear household poverty risks together, there is a pronounced gender gap in individual poverty risk across countries. Men, regardless of their education and fatherhood status, have a relatively low individual poverty risk, with little difference between income pooling scenarios. Conversely, women, especially low-educated mothers, have a higher individual than household poverty risk. Observed cross-country variations highlight that the relationship between motherhood and poverty risk is context-specific. Although education is often promoted as a shield against poverty, in some countries, such as Austria, highly educated mothers also face a high individual poverty risk.",

    "description": "The theoretical proposition that social networks contribute to class divides in political attitudes has rarely been further developed or empirically scrutinized with individual-level data on a large cross-national scale. In this article, we theorize and empirically examine how the class profiles of personal networks may shape individual attitudes to income inequality from a country-comparative perspective. Using multilevel modeling and data from the ISSP Social Networks and Resources module, covering 29 countries, we find that having more family, friends, and acquaintances in upper-middle-class positions is associated with lower support for reducing inequality, while having more social ties to working-class positions is associated with higher support for reducing inequality. We also assess how these relationships differ across countries depending on the institutional context, finding that both own class location and the class profiles of personal networks are more strongly related to attitudes to income inequality in countries with a higher rate of government redistribution. The study provides new theoretical and empirical insights into the importance of personal networks\u2019 class profiles for shaping individual attitudes and structural ideological divisions linked to economic inequality, while also suggesting that social networks are key to understanding institutionally embedded distributive conflicts from a country-comparative perspective.",

    "description": "In response to a remarkably high out of pocket (OOP) health expenditure in India, various state and the national governments in India, tried to introduce public health insurance programs. Despite being free, the take up and utilization of these programs remain low. In this paper, we seek to explain this puzzle by studying the role of informal networks in explaining insurance-adoption behavior in the context of the Arogyasri health insurance program introduced in the erstwhile state of Andhra Pradesh between 2007 and 2008. We use household panel data from the Young Lives Survey (YLS) to empirically study how the adoption of Arogyasri among poor households respond to their membership in informal networks. In this context, we differentiate between two types of network \u2013 financial network and information network. We find that adoption and utilization are significantly higher for households with access to informal financial networks. However, adoption and utilization increases much more for households outside informal networks, after they experience health shocks. Information sharing role of informal networks do not seem to affect the decision to adopt insurance. We also provide a simple theoretical framework to discuss the potential mechanisms underlying our empirical results.",

    "description": "Despite the increasing popularity and importance of mobile instant messenger services (MIMSs) such as WhatsApp, Telegram and Signal, the vast majority of the research on social media is focused on the \u201ctraditional\u201d social media platforms such as Twitter and Facebook, mostly due to the difficulty of accessing MIMSs data. Consequently, we lack knowledge about even the most basic topological features of the societal-scale instant messenger network. To overcome this knowledge gap, we employ the innovative approach of data donation by respondents of a high-quality probability-based panel in the Netherlands (the LISS panel) to collect user data while preserving their privacy. Focusing on WhatsApp as the most popular MIMS, this study collects the first measurement of MIMS usage on a national probability sample. We find that the degree distribution of contacts is best approximated by a log-normal distribution, while the distribution of group membership is best approximated by the exponential distribution. At the individual level, we find that predictors of degree derived from the literature on extended networks mostly replicate.",

State-imposed \"monetary policies\" not only expropriate this increase in wealth attributed to deflation (a fiscal motive) but also penalize consumers for postponing their consumption of goods and services (a form of social engineering). Consequently, there is a shortfall in the state's legal frameworks adequately protecting consumer freedom and property rights. In response, the Bitcoin network has emerged as a private currency governed by a distinct legal framework rooted in proof-of-work. Consumers holding Bitcoin benefit from the economic advantages of global deflation-advantages often usurped by central banks-and experience enhanced freedom to delay consumption, navigating their life paths free from the constraints of social engineering. Thus, Bitcoin contributes value by addressing the shortfall in state legal systems that safeguard consumer freedom and property rights",

This article discusses the immigrant-native gap regarding the risk of overeducation for 28 European countries on the basis of the EU-LFS 2021 ad hoc module. Immigrants\u2019 higher overeducation risks are interpreted as the result of processes of legal closure as well as statistical and taste-based discrimination. Higher overeducation rates of third country nationals (TCN) in contrast to EU migrants indicate that EU citizenship reduces discrimination and facilitates the recognition of educational certificates \u2013 they are skill-preserving devices for EU citizens but not for TCN. The large overeducation rates in particular in Southern Europe can be explained by segmented labour markets with higher unemployment and lower skill requirements increase overeducation risks, in particular for TCN.

    "description": "There is considerable debate about the fairness of university admissions processes, particularly in national contexts with substantial prestige differences between providers. However, there does tend to be agreement that admissions processes should be transparent. This study investigates the extent to which undergraduate university admissions in the UK are transparent, particularly with regard to their use of an admissions essay called the UCAS personal statement. Our methods are twofold: 1) we assess whether university staff use the personal statement in ways that align with information on student-facing websites, and 2) we perform an in-depth transparency analysis of fifteen university course websites to assess the extent to which universities helped applicants to understand what a high-quality personal statement looked like. We find considerable evidence of issues related to transparency, with some examples of good practice. The paper concludes with several recommendations for providers to enhance their transparency. The 2025-26 reforms to the UCAS personal statement offer an opportunity for all universities to update their public-facing websites and guidance, so this paper represents a timely intervention.",

    "link": "https://share.osf.io/preprint/E008E-88A-DEB",
    "description": "Styles of traditional decorative art vary substantially across cultures. While early theorists attributed this variation to differences in environment, scholarship has long focused on decorative artworks as vehicles of social information and stylistic variation as a consequence of social factors. However, if the capacity to create and consume art evolved as a mechanism to shape shared attention, it is possible that environmental factors may indeed play a role in variation of decorative style. We tested this hypothesis by characterizing the compositional structure of 198 textiles from eighteen cultures across the globe using the complexity-entropy plane. Entropy and statistical complexity have previously been used to characterize changes in the compositional structure of paintings of the Western canon over the last millennium. We observed that complexity and entropy are useful measures for characterizing traditional textile designs: high-entropy/low-complexity samples feature dense repetitions of small Euclidean shapes, while low-entropy/high-complexity samples feature large, single-color fields with bold borders. We observed weak-but-significant associations between these measures and three environmental variables: absolute latitude, Koppen climate classification, and a composite variable representing subsistence mode. Interestingly, we observed a significant difference between works from Afro-Eurasia/Oceania and the Americas. Controlling for this and other factors related to social transmission improves the strength of the relationship between compositional structure and subsistence mode. We propose that aesthetic preferences may be affected by subsistence mode as well as cultural factors, and suggest that further studies with more granular environmental data are necessary. We further discuss potential explanations for the observed difference between \"hemispheres.\"",

Building on the structural sexism and health perspective, we argue that systemic gender inequality is a conceptually important\u2014and understudied\u2014factor in early childbearing. Using survey data from the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent to Adult Health (N = 5,052 female respondents and 32,595 person-years) merged to state, county, and school characteristics, we investigate how exposure to structural sexism during adolescence shapes early childbearing. We measure structural sexism in institutional domains with state and county-level measures of economic, cultural, and reproductive health. We also generate a novel measure of structural sexism in interactional domains, capturing gendered expectations, power dynamics, and conservative religious beliefs among school peers. We find that institutional sexism is associated with a higher likelihood of early childbearing among young women racialized as Black, but not among those racialized as White. Interactional sexism is also a significant predictor of early childbearing, and is especially salient for adolescents as they turn to peers for social cues about gender roles. Our results underscore the importance of institutional and interactional forces for shaping families and raise questions about increasingly polarized gender climates post-Dobbs.",

    "description": "While the causes of the international youth crime decline have been disputed, it has been proposed that changing policing responses may have contributed. This study examines whether increased rates of police-led diversion have contributed to the youth crime decline in Australia. Fixed effects panel regressions were undertaken to examine the association between police diversion rates and youth crime prevalence, recidivism and mean reoffending across regions in New South Wales and Victoria, from 2005 to 2019. Findings indicated a significant decline in youth offending prevalence in this period, but also a decline in police diversion rates for young people, and a lack of association between diversion rates and youth offending prevalence. In contrast, youth recidivism increased over the same period. However, diversion rates were negatively associated with youth recidivism and mean levels of reoffending at a regional level, such that regions with higher diversion rates had lower levels of youth reoffending. Findings also indicate that the youth offending decline in Australia has been conditioned by socio-economic characteristics, with growth in youth offending evident in more socio-economically deprived regions. Implications for drivers of the youth crime decline and policing responses to young people are discussed.",

Over one-quarter of respondents were not using their preferred method; among them, nearly half preferred vasectomy, condoms, or withdrawal. Partner disagreement was the most common reason for nonpreferred use and was associated with experiencing partner contraceptive coercion. Black women, who face structural racism in the health care system, were more likely to attribute their nonpreferred use to a provider\u2019s recommendation. These findings demonstrate how gender and power shape contraceptive use despite the preferences of those at risk of pregnancy, highlighting the need for cultural, policy, and health care shifts to resolve contraceptive preference-use discordance and increase gender equity in the responsibility of pregnancy prevention.",

    "description": "Indian students\u2019 ideas about climate change are a mix of incomplete knowledge and misconceptions. Students are also apprehensive about climate change and feel helpless in the face of it. Formal teaching about climate change is fragmented across subjects, and limited to explanations of the scientific mechanisms, ignoring the entire socio-economic, historical and political context that led to and perpetuates the phenomenon. This empirical research explores the outcomes from the Young Climate Authors, a holistic climate justice intervention where middle & high schoolers wrote storybooks on climate change. The program was implemented with a cohort of 18 10-15 year olds in Chennai, India in 2023. Data in the form of pretest, midpoint & postttest questionnaires, semi structured interviews, focus group discussions, and student artefacts was analyzed using Template Analysis. Results reveal that the YCA had a transformative decolonizing impact by created a sense of proto-conscientization based on deepened place-ecological meaning. The participants\u2019 understanding of climate change shifted from vague, \u2018textbook\u2019ish knowledge to a nuanced and holistic understanding impacting Chennai, its marginalized communities and the more-than-human. Emotion was deeply intertwined in this understanding where a sense of empathy and anger, that the learning had engendered, shaped the storybooks that were written. The scientific understanding of climate change also improved. The results highlight the importance of using critical and constructivist pedagogy for climate change education which shape place-based and decolonized student ideas about climate change.",

    "description": "Carbon taxation is widely embraced as an effective tool for reducing emissions, yet it is economically regressive, disproportionately affecting economically vulnerable groups. Hence, it is no surprise that carbon taxes often are perceived as unfair, and if implemented without consideration of distributive effects, they risk generating polarization and climate policy setbacks, as well as increasing existing inequalities. We provide the first causal analysis of how and to what extent existing social protection programs could be used to reduce opposition to carbon taxes. We employ a conjoint experiment targeting 5,188 respondents from Sweden to assess the causal effect of increased generosity in pensions, sickness insurance, unemployment insurance, and child benefits, benchmarked against the effect of monthly monetary handouts. Our findings suggest that increasing benefit generosity within each of the four examined social protection programs reduces opposition to carbon taxation. Most importantly, increased old age pension generosity have a substantial and significant impact across various demographic groups, regardless of the respondents\u2019 political affiliation. This effect is more potent than other compensatory measures, a critical insight in the search for socially acceptable climate policy strategies that avoid increasing inequalities.",

This paper examines how the Second Great Migration (1940\u20131970) spurred structural change in the American South between 1970 and 2010. Empirical results using shift-share instruments show that out-migration incentivized capital investment and capital-augmenting technical change, increasing capital per worker and output in both agriculture and manufacturing, at least until 2010. Labor was reallocated from agriculture to non-agriculture. I then develop a dynamic spatial equilibrium model that allows for substitution between factors of production, factor-biased technical change, and factor abundance-based trade to characterize this process. The quantitative analysis indicates that labor-capital substitution played a major role in adjustments to South-to-North migration.",

    "link": "https://share.osf.io/preprint/E0135-838-D6F",
    "description": "Current prominent music evolution theories suggest music evolved as a participatory group activity, whose adaptive functions were strengthening and/or signaling social cohesion. However, the prevalence of collective music-making varies substantially across societies, and in some cases is exceptionally rare. Here, we consider hypotheses for three factors which could attenuate collective music-making: diminished collective action more generally, an emphasis on musical expertise, and solo-oriented musical styles. We look at data related to these hypotheses in four societies in which collective music-making is rare: the Tsimane of lowland Bolivia, the Ache of eastern Paraguay, the Ayoreo of Bolivia and Paraguay, and the Tuvans of the Russian Republic of Tyva. Our results suggest that the scale and religiosity of collective action is the most important factor related to the overall degree of collective music-making in a culture. The effect of musical expertise was mostly limited to the dominance of shamans in religious contexts, while well-developed solo musical styles did not necessarily prevent group performance in other social settings. We also note the importance of cultural loss due to influence of invading colonial and imperial forces in diminishing indigenous forms of collective music-making. Notably, in all the cases we consider, episodes of some form of collective music-making do (or historically did) occur during important social events, a fact which supports the group-functionalist view. Our findings also point to the centrality and ubiquity of the religious function of music, and suggest this aspect of musical behavior needs to be better addressed by evolutionary theories of music.",

    "description": "This chapter commences with the presentation of three questions. Firstly, what are the strengths of political and social science research work on associationism? Secondly, which areas have been treated with a greater degree of ideological bias and would therefore benefit from a more critical realist approach (Pratschke, 2003)? Thirdly, what insights have been gained? In responding to these queries, the chapter considers the ways in which research has frequently examined associationism with a view to elucidating broader dynamics, including those pertaining to politics, professionalisation, organisation, community, elites, cooperation, and categories of stratification. As we examine the ways in which cities engage with associations, we observe a multiplicity of modes of governance, a diversity of instruments of public action, and a structure of associational opportunities. This allows us to investigate the mechanisms and processes involved, adopting a historical and comparative approach that aligns with Weberian principles.",

    "description": "Purpose \u2014 This paper aims to investigate how best to classify money laundering through online video games (i.e. virtual laundering). Currently, there is no taxonomy available for scholars and practitioners to refer to when discussing money laundering through online video games. Without a well-defined taxonomy it becomes difficult to reason through, formulate and implement effective regulatory measures, policies and security controls. As such, efforts to prevent and reduce virtual laundering incidence rates are hampered. Design/methodology/approach \u2014 This paper proposes three mutually exclusive virtual laundering categorizations. However, instead of fixating on the processes undergirding individual instances of virtual laundering, it is argued that focusing on the initial locale of the illicit proceeds provides the appropriate framing within which to classify instances of virtual laundering. Thus, the act of classification becomes an ontological endeavor, rather than an attempt at elucidating an inherently varied process (as is common of the placement, layering and integration model).

    "description": "I introduce a new model for predicting presidential election outcomes, using it to forecast the two-party Democratic vote share and the electoral college results for the 2024 election. The national two-party vote share prediction builds on the economic fundamentals model from Fair (2009), enhanced by incorporating a candidate quality differential measure based on newspaper endorsements from DeLuca (2024), resulting in what I call the Economy-Quality Model. According to this model, Kamala Harris is projected to win the popular vote with 52.5% of the two-party vote share, approximately 1.5-2 points higher than most other forecasts and polling averages. I then calculate each state\u2019s deviation from the national vote share (its relative Democratic or Republican lean) based on recent high-quality polling, adding these deviations to the Economy-Quality Model\u2019s national prediction to derive state-level predictions and electoral college results. The model forecasts Kamala Harris winning the electoral college with 319 votes.",

    "description": "This study uses a quasi-experimental design to investigate the causal impact of an extended school week on educational performance in 22 Dutch primary schools. The intervention has been partly modeled after the prominent Harlem Children\u2019s Zone (HCZ). To assess the impact of the intervention, we leverage register data containing information on all Dutch children finishing primary school in the period 2009 - 2022. Synthetic control analysis is applied to estimate the causal effect for each individual school. The findings show the program has had limited effect on educational outcomes with little variation between schools. Our contribution is in showing how several factors, such as goal switching, lack of participation, and teacher shortages, hamper program effectiveness and discussing to what extent a concept such as the HCZ is transferable to other international contexts. Finally, we also illustrate how the synthetic control method can be applied in educational research.",

    "link": "https://share.osf.io/preprint/E0139-D55-E8A",
    "description": "This article analyses the (post)colonial politics of UK bordering through the lens of monstrosity. Historicising contemporary bordering within colonial-era monsterisations of racialised people and their mobility, we identify four mechanisms through which migrants are constructed and policed as monsters today: animalisation, zombification, criminalisation and barbarisation. We then examine how the state embodies monstrosity itself through border policies of deterrence and creating \u2018hostile environments\u2019. In addition to the instrumentalization of horror, this entails extending the border\u2019s reach domestically throughout everyday life and internationally through deportation and externalisation measures. We argue these developments embody a new form of state power, depicted as a headless tentacled Leviathan. Doing so provides insights into monstrosity as a form of liberal statecraft, the local/global diffusion of bordering, the transnationalisation of sovereign power, and the racialisation of citizenship. It also raises important questions about the construction of border violence as a necessary and legitimate monstrosity in (post)colonial liberal societies, the everyday complicity of citizens, and the limits of efforts to humanise monsterised migrants or reform monstrous state institutions. Revealing how within liberal regimes of citizenship and humanitarianism values \u2018there be monsters\u2019, we argue, opens space for thinking about abolitionist alternatives in international politics.",

    "link": "https://share.osf.io/preprint/E0162-063-CEA",
    "description": "People\u2019s environmental conceptions influence the manner in which they engage with the world around them and are fundamental to processes of environmental decision-making. In order to fully grasp the meaning of such conceptions, ontological approaches exhort anthropologists to reconceptualize their own notions in order to understand people\u2019s statements. Such approaches foreground difference, to the extent that members of distinct societies are considered to live in fundamentally different, incommensurable worlds. These theoretical postures, however, have been criticized for their emphasis on radical alterity and for portraying ontologies as homogeneous and static, ignoring cultural change and ethnographic heterogeneity, typical of anthropological research. Additionally, important theoretical and methodological issues are still unresolved, e.g., how to know if people\u2019s utterances are meant to be taken as literal truths. This paper addresses this criticism and empirically explores conceptual arrangements by considering diversity and practice as constitutive of ontologies. Using qualitative and quantitative methods, this study explores the variety of notions of non-human beings held by members of an Indigenous Matsigenka community in Amazonian Peru. Ethnographic participant observation and a Bayesian statistical analysis of patterns of agreement and disagreement among community members suggest that ontological configurations are diverse, sometimes multiple and context-dependent, and are associated with specialized roles that influence people\u2019s engagements with non-human beings in their daily lives. An understanding of these diverse, enacted conceptions sheds light on nuances of how humans interact with their surroundings.",

    "description": "Wilderness and adventure therapy (WT, AT) have employed cognitive or adaptive dissonance and involuntary treatment for decades. Cognitive dissonance occurs when people are faced with situations that do not confirm their expectations. Past WT participants have protested that involuntary, inescapable and harsh conditions harmed them through PTSD and dissociation. We compare dissonance and dissociation using a critical realist and argumentative research process using publicly available data. We argue that dissociation is a response, recorded both in the design of WT and in participant statement, that is mistaken for dissonance. Deliberate use of forced cognitive dissonance during involuntary treatments are also the conditions that may cause dissociation. Therefore, planning to enforce cognitive dissonance during coercive WT or AT is likely to be harmful and, knowing of this potential, may be regarded as malpractice.",

    "description": "The transformation of social movement collective identity\u2014the members shared under-standing of the movement\u2019s purpose, goals and means\u2014is a central concern of move-ment scholars. A main driver of such transformations is disputes over framing the movements\u2019 purpose, which arise due to the entrance of new micro-cohorts of activists with different views than those of the veteran cohorts. This paper provides unique in-sight into the rarely studied process of such frame disputes by studying the entrance in-to the refugee solidarity movement of a new micro-cohort of activists mobilized in re-sponse to the 2022 war in Ukraine. While united in the endeavor to assist the victims of the war in Ukraine, veteran activists and newcomer activists strongly disagree on whether other groups of refugees should be entitled to the same relatively high level of help offered to the Ukrainian refugees. Online ethnography of movement activity on the social media of Facebook allows us to access the framing disputes as they unfold. While major ideological differences exist between the veteran and newcomer cohorts, frame disputes are rare. Rather than the expected clash between cohorts, we find that the contentious and humanitarian practices were compartmentalized into different Facebook fora.",

We argue that many studies do not have the adequate point of comparison in order to determine the con- tribution of digital networks relative to other organizational forms, such as formal volunteering. Using an original population survey on volunteer- ing during the COVID crisis, we compare digital networks to other types of organizations in terms of the relative volume of participation, the type of participation, the persistence of the volunteer , and volunteers socio- economic and demographic characteristics. We find that digital networks contributed substantially in terms of volume, and the type of participation was not comparatively cheap. Yet, we find less persistence among digital volunteers compared to volunteers active in formal civil society organisa- tions(CSO). Lastly, we find that digital volunteers typically have shorter education compared to those who are active in formal CSOs. We end by discussing the implications of our results.",

We draw on interviews with 67 immigration advocates representing 76 immigrant-serving nonprofits across the United States between November 2021 and February 2023. The interviews affirm advocates and their organizations\u2019 important frontline roles in reducing systemic harm by addressing immigrants\u2019 immediate material, social, and/or legal needs. Yet, when it comes to preventing harm by reforming or transforming the immigration system, many advocates believe their efforts do little but maintain the system\u2019s structure. Advocates attribute this dynamic to several sources, including the ever-evolving harms of the current system; the demands of the public and private funders their organizations rely on; intraorganizational challenges common to immigrant-serving organizations; and the perceived immovability of the national, state, and local political contexts they work in. We conclude with several immediate and long-range suggestions for immigration advocates to consider as they continue their work.",

It is conducted by a collective of transdisciplinary researchers and community members who shape knowledge production based on their unique experience and opinions about which situations are deemed essential for emancipatory action.

As the global population ages, the demand for adaptive technologies that support aging in place increases, while healthcare resources grow increasingly strained. LLMs represent a promising avenue for addressing this gap by offering culturally competent, conversational interfaces capable of supporting cognitive function. Despite current limitations in context retention and response accuracy, advancements in LLM technology could enhance personalization and continuity of care, potentially transforming LLMs into significant companions for older adults experiencing cognitive decline.

    "description": "This paper examines the rapid growth of China\u2019s science and technology (S&amp;T) sector within the broader context of higher education, focusing on the often-overlooked role of Hong Kong in this transformation. While conventional explanations emphasize China\u2019s relationship with the United States, this study argues that Hong Kong has played a crucial, yet underappreciated, role in advancing China\u2019s higher education and S&amp;T capabilities. Despite its reputation as a finance-driven city, Hong Kong has developed a robust academic and scientific community that fostered close collaborations with mainland institutions. In the 1990s, as Hong Kong\u2019s research doctoral programs were gaining momentum, mainland students sought high-quality advanced training, and members of the overseas Chinese academic diaspora returned to join Hong Kong universities. This cross-border collaboration thrived despite cultural and ideological differences, combining the mainland\u2019s motivated talent pool with Hong Kong\u2019s free academic environment. Using a comprehensive dataset from the Web of Science, institutional archives, university leader biographies, and PhD dissertation records from Hong Kong\u2019s top universities, this paper provides both quantitative and qualitative analyses of the historical collaboration between Hong Kong and mainland China. The findings reveal that this relationship was evolutionary, initiated by forward-thinking educators long before formal mechanisms were in place, and was instrumental in China\u2019s rise to global prominence in higher education and S&amp;T. By revisiting this underexplored dimension of China\u2019s educational development, this paper offers a new understanding of the forces behind the country\u2019s remarkable achievements in higher education and scientific research.",

How do ordinary citizens perceive the integrity of elections in such regime environments? We argue that government supporters adopt the incumbent's narrative to consider elections fair and legitimate. In contrast, opposition supporters regard elections in such systems as biased and not meaningful. We provide evidence from large cross-country public opinion data and the unexpected 2018 Turkish snap election announcement to examine long- and short-term patterns of perceived electoral integrity. We find that the partisan gap in perceived electoral integrity is more substantial under electoral authoritarianism than under democratic rule. The partisan gap grows in autocratizing political systems, and these perceptions are mostly stable in the short term, even at times of radically increased salience of electoral competition. Our study yields implications for the dynamics between elites and citizens in autocracies in which elections remain a critical source of regime legitimacy.",

Analyses on data with the names of over 300\u2009million Americans demonstrate that name-based racial composition more fully explains socioeconomic disparities among neighborhoods than conventional survey-based racial composition metrics. Neighborhoods with the most Black-sounding names demonstrate greater socioeconomic disadvantage than neighborhoods with the most individuals self-identifying as Black. Additionally, naming patterns explain variation in socioeconomic inequality within both predominantly nominally Black neighborhoods and predominantly nominally White neighborhoods\u2014where little nominal racial variation exists. This research suggests that infracategorical measures of race can provide additional predictive power to nominal measures of racial composition when analyzing neighborhood inequalities",

    "link": "https://share.osf.io/preprint/E0194-285-033",
    "description": "While a large literature has studied the effects of violent conflict on health outcomes, little is known about how violence reduction can affect a key driver of post-conflict recovery, namely the quantity and skills composition of healthcare workers. By leveraging a permanent ceasefire that ended over five decades of armed conflict between the Colombian government and the FARC insurgency, we study the extent to which conflict termination affected the share of different types of health workers in areas more exposed to FARC violence relative to other places. Based on administrative records on the location of all formal healthcare workers in Colombia and using a difference-in-differences strategy, we find that a municipality that experienced one standard deviation higher FARC violence intensity relative to the rest of the country witnessed 13.4% post-ceasefire differential decrease in the share of employed healthcare workers per 1,000 people. We find a stronger decrease among vocational nurses and a weaker decrease among physicians. We show that this effect is likely explained by lifting mobility restrictions in previously violent areas, and document that, because the net reduction in healthcare workers increased the within-municipality share of (more productive) physicians, it did not translate into a deterioration of mortality rates or healthcare service provision.",

    "description": "We study bias in judicial authorities' efforts to rehabilitate and reintegrate immigrant offenders into society. Our empirical strategy leverages a unique feature of the German criminal code: the optional application of rehabilitative juvenile criminal law or punitive general criminal law for 18-20-year-old offenders, based on a subjective assessment of offenders' psychological `maturity' by judges. Drawing on complete records of 792,000 court hearings between 2009 and 2018, we show that immigrant offenders are about ten percentage points less likely to be sentenced under juvenile law compared to natives convicted for the same crime. The immigrant-native gap in rehabilitative justice correlates with anti-immigrant sentiment across space and has spiked in recent years, suggesting a link between the salience of group-based identities and judicial decision-making. Our findings raise concerns about equal legal treatment and highlight that biases in the application of rehabilitative justice may contribute to higher recidivism rates among immigrant offenders.",

    "description": "The study presents a new approach for constructing an epistemological coordinate system that locates individual researchers within the disciplinary landscape of science. Drawing on a comprehensive national dataset of scientific outputs, we build a topic model based on a semantic network of publications and terms derived from textual content comprising titles, s, and keywords. Compositional data transformation applied to the topic model enables a geometric analysis of topics across disciplines. The design yields four important results for addressing the gap between knowledge and knowledge-producers. 1) Hierarchical clustering confirms an alignment between traditional disciplinary classification and our empirical, bottom-up topic model. 2) Principal component analysis reveals three axes \u2014 Culture- Nature, Life-Non-life, and Materials-Methods \u2014 that primarily structure this scientific knowledge space. 3) The projection of individual researchers via their topic portfolios allows to locate them relationally on these three continuous measures of epistemological distinctions. 4) The robustness of our approach is validated by examining the links between researchers\u2019 topic orientation and supplementary variables such as publication practices, gender, institutional a\ufb00iliations, and funding sources. Our method could inform science policy and evaluation practices, as well as be extended to uncover associations between products and producers in other cultural fields.",

    "description": "Climate-facilitated spread of mosquito-borne pathogens to new environments elevates the importance of policies that limit greenhouse gas emissions as well as the development and uptake of new pharmaceutical interventions. Whereas past research attempts to bolster support for both through either climate or health risk communication, fewer attempt to combine the risks borne by climate change and infectious disease with a single messaging intervention, i.e., co-constitutive risk messaging (CCR), a strategy of an integrative approach we call One Health Communication. In a pre-registered experiment embedded in a nationally representative survey (N = 2,200), we test whether CCR messaging impacts support for pharmaceutical interventions to minimize dengue fever health risks and/or policy efforts to mitigate climate change. We find that CCR messages are generally effective at increasing support for pharmaceutical interventions aimed at ameliorating the health risks posed by dengue fever. Moreover, we find suggestive evidence that people who hold more-collectivistic worldviews are especially receptive to messages that emphasize the public (vs the personal) health risks of dengue fever. In post hoc exploratory analyses, we show that CCR messages effect public support for climate change mitigation policies among those who express doubts about human-caused climate change. We conclude by discussing the usefulness of CCR messaging, and One Health Communication approaches more broadly, in various strategic communication contexts and considering additional avenues for future research.",

Thematic analysis of all three studies resulted in four themes that informed the CT-informed AT (CTIAT) framework: (1) voluntary participation, (2) dignity of experience, (3) relational care, and (4) the development of a sense of self. Results highlighted the importance of eliminating coercion and replacing manualised treatment models with practitioner reflexivity.

In this paper, we assess whether the MWM framework adequately measures what people in Australia value for their wellbeing by examining both the process of the framework\u2019s development and its content. Firstly, we consider whether the consultation process undertaken was adequate. Secondly, we examine whether the MWM indicators align with existing research on what people in Australia value for their wellbeing. We identified limitations across all four aspects of the consultation examined: its comprehensiveness, reach, transparency, and extent to which it genuinely incorporated community feedback into the framework. While the MWM framework was found to broadly align with existing research on what Australians value for their wellbeing, there were some notable divergences. We urge the Australian Government to undertake a comprehensive, wide-reaching, transparent, and genuine consultation across Australia. Furthermore, we recommend that the Australian Government develop new indicators in consultation with the public. Enhancing the MWM framework will help establish it as a cornerstone of government decision-making, and importantly, ensure that it does what it purports to do: measure what Australians value for their wellbeing.",

    "description": "This report investigates the feasibility of developing a holistic indicator to assess and communicate the social sustainability and quality of life in Vancouver. Despite the availability of various specific metrics, there is a noted absence of a comprehensive framework that integrates these metrics to provide a singular, actionable view of the city's progress towards its social sustainability goals. The City of Vancouver currently employs 45 population-level indicators under its Healthy City Strategy, demonstrating the city's commitment to transparent and data-driven governance. However, these indicators, while effective individually, do not collectively provide a complete picture of the city's overall health across various dimensions such as public health, housing, education, and environmental sustainability. The aim of this research was to identify a holistic indicator that encompasses multiple dimensions of social sustainability to simplify assessments and improve strategic planning. Through a desktop review of 70 existing indicators and consultations with experts, two models were identified as particularly promising: the Greater London Authority's (GLA) Wellbeing and Sustainability Measure, and the City of Calgary's Equity Index (CEI). These models offer robust frameworks that prioritize equity, accessibility, and stakeholder involvement, aligning closely with Vancouver's urban development goals. This work highlights the need for an overarching metric that reflects the interdependencies among various domains, ensuring that progress in one area does not undermine another. By leveraging insights from this research, Vancouver can enhance its policy implementation and community engagement, moving closer to achieving a balanced and sustainable urban environment. The proposed holistic indicator will also support the city in benchmarking against other urban centers and refining its strategic initiatives based on quantifiable metrics.",

    "description": "This study proposed a strategy for causal identification in survey experiments by leveraging heteroscedasticity induced through information provision (Z). Here, Z affects attitudes (D), which in turn influences behavior (Y). While Z might traditionally serve as an instrumental variable (IV), a direct effect from Z to the outcome variable (Y) would invalidate it as an IV due to exclusion restriction violations. Building on prior methods, such as Lewbel\u2019s IV approach, which utilize naturally occurring heteroscedasticity in observational data, this study explored the artificial induction of heteroscedasticity within survey experiments. We developed a new unbiased estimator within linear structural model and conducted simulations to confirm that this new estimator outperforms conventional IV estimators. We further addressed the issue of endogenous non-compliance, and discussed that under the homogeneous function assumption, manipulating information ambiguity can yield a consistent bias-corrected estimator. This approach can enhance the possibility of causal identification by survey experiments and extend heteroscedasticity-based methodologies to complex compliance contexts, offering new tools for robust experimental design.",

    "description": "The traditional framework of fertility research conceptualizes childbirth from the mother's perspective. From her perspective, birth is an uncertain and potentially recurring event. In contrast, the Born once, die once (B1D1) framework conceptualizes birth as an event experienced by the child. From its perspective, birth is certain and, like death, occurs only once. As an advantage over the traditional approach, the child's perspective allows for the use of density, survival, and hazard functions to study fertility age patterns at the macro level using birth counts for all parities by maternal age. Here, we reformulate the B1D1 framework using fertility rate notation and extend the traditional fertility framework by analogous density, survival, and hazard functions. We compare this extended traditional framework with the B1D1 framework using data on Swedish cohorts born in the 19th and 20th centuries. Large historical differences between the density, survival, and hazard functions in the two frameworks have diminished for more recent cohorts, suggesting converging conclusions about fertility age patterns. The new density, survival, and hazard functions can shed new light on differences in fertility age patterns across populations and advance traditional fertility research, including by capturing fertility and mortality age patterns with common concepts and measures.",

To address this challenge, the \"Seeds of a Good Anthropocene\u201d (SoGA) project began over a decade ago, in 2014. The project seeks to identify and amplify existing, innovative, non-mainstream sustainability initiatives, which we call \u201cseeds\u201d, that have the potential to contribute to new development pathways and create positive futures. These \u201cseeds\u201d offer tangible examples of how positive change is already happening out of the mainstream, and imagining how they could grow provides a useful way of describing different plausible, desirable futures and articulating pathways to move towards those futures. This paper reviews the history of the SoGA project, its theoretical underpinnings, and its ongoing impact on futures thinking, scenario development, and sustainability science. Combining personal reflections of the project's founders with a bibliometric analysis of over 30 peer-reviewed papers connected to the SoGA project, the paper identifies key people, places, and ideas that have contributed to the project.

King County, Washington, twelfth largest U.S. county, hosts the third largest homeless population, many of whom reside in Seattle. Discouraging encampments and providing shelter beds has proven ineffective. We investigate how street survivors make encampment choices based on amenities proximity compared to those in shelters and rental units. We analyze rich spatial, administrative, and outreach worker data from Seattle\u2019s Evergreen Treatment Services (REACH) on people living unsheltered (from 2016 to 2022). We discuss the implications of providing effective support for people living unhoused, and provide what is \u2014 to our knowledge \u2014 the most comprehensive and recent study of neighborhood access and proximity to amenities among the unsheltered population in Seattle, WA. We find that encampment locations more closely reflected the access of renting, housed populations across all amenities in the majority of neighborhoods., and that some amenities provide an opportunity for personal agency with regard to basic needs, particularly food-related amenities (with the exception of food banks), were closer to encampments than shelters. We conclude that housing options that feel like homes rather than institutions are critical to support the unhoused. In the interim, shelters should be more integrated into neighborhoods, and better reflect tent encampment and rental trends. Policymakers and practitioners must provide effective support that centers on autonomy, dignity, and harm reduction for those who survive outside.",

With the China Family Panel Studies data, our measurement uncovers the sustainable effects and mechanisms of household participation in the multi-pillar pension system on poverty mitigation. The results indicate that more participation in the pension system mitigates the probability of being trapped in multidimensional poverty. The findings reveal the significance of state social insurance, enterprise annuity, and individual commercial insurance. The mitigation effect of market-oriented pillars is achieved through more investment in and consumption for livelihood assets. Based upon the sustainable livelihoods framework, livelihood assets ameliorate household capabilities in human, natural, financial, and psychological capital against risks, shocks, and uncertainties.

However, population forecasts are often produced at coarse scales, namely national and regional, and state of the art small area forecasting methods are scarce and adjusted to work on Global North countries. We aim to explore the accuracy of autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA) models to forecast population totals and age-group populations at the intraurban level for the municipalities of Greater Mexico City. We use WorldPop 2000-10 population estimates as input data and perform retrospective forecasts for 2011-20. Comparing our forecasts with actual population counts, we found that ARIMA models return a median error of 1.5% when forecasting population totals in a 10-year horizon, and 5.7% for population forecasts by age-group. The age-groups 0-14, 15-39 and 40-64 performed particularly well, with error levels below 5% in most municipalities, while the age-group 65+ displays higher errors, typically over 20%. We conclude that ARIMA models outperform accuracy levels of small area population forecasts from previous studies which use different methods across the Global North. Yet, ARIMA models have limitations. They are powerful when rates of population change are linear or unchanged but cannot predict sudden changes in demographic components or ageing processes in cohorts with different population size.",

Black students are substantially less likely than white students to enroll in advanced math courses in 8th grade and beyond. Unfortunately, prior research has failed to produce a consistent explanation for these racial inequalities. In this article, we develop an analytic framework that overcomes numerous limitations in prior studies. Our framework shows how racialized sorting between schools constrains course-taking opportunities and shapes achievement distributions within schools (local achievement queues), both of which affect how course placements are made within a given school. We analyze administrative data for multiple cohorts of 8th-grade students in the state of Indiana. Our findings show that course-taking opportunities in 8th-grade math vary markedly across schools, and Black students are much more likely than white students to attend schools that offer no advanced courses (Algebra or Geometry). By failing to account for this structural inequality, prior research has underestimated racial inequality in course placements. However, our analyses also show that racial segregation across schools improves the position of Black students within their local achievement queues, which increases their chances of enrolling in advanced math courses. Our findings highlight the central importance of schools as key organizational units in explaining racial inequality in course placements.",

    "description": "Rock surface alterations due to weathering have often been used by archaeologists for creating chronologies, studying climatic conditions, and authenticating artifacts. Rock surface alterations are also important for identifying recycled artifacts through the presence of \u201cdouble patina.\u201d In the surface archaeological deposits at Semizbugu (Saryarqa, Kazakhstan), rock surface weathering stages are used to chronologically categorize stone tool artifacts based on perceived associations between weathering characteristics and typology. Despite a long history of studying rock surface weathering in geological sciences, the formation of rock coatings on stone tool artifacts is a largely misunderstood process due to its complexity and multi-factored formation process. Given the consistent use of one raw material at Semizbugu, we test for differences in rock coating morphologies, elemental composition, and surface roughness between macroscopically identified weathering stages. Based on our analyses, we identify multiple processes involved in artifact weathering at Semizbugu. We suggest that artifacts at Semizbugu may be relatively chronologically ordered based on a combined assessment of decreased surface roughness and increased surface pitting, both of which are likely related to degree of wind abrasion and dissolution of the artifact surface. We also recommend against using rock varnish color for chronological assessment of artifacts at Semizbugu given the destructive effects of abrasion and the irregularities of varnish formation in semi-arid contexts. Additionally, we suggest this model be validated with rock surface exposure dating via optically stimulated luminescence (OSL-surf). Furthermore, rock surface exposure OSL dating could give us insight into the time-depth between use and recycling events in a more meaningful way than trying to compare differential artifact surface weathering across \u201cdouble patina.\u201d",

    "link": "https://share.osf.io/preprint/E010D-18B-523",
    "description": "Gender scholars have debated whether the recent movement toward a more equal division of domestic labor is stalling. Using a differential convergence perspective, we argue that examining which domestic tasks experience gender convergence, whose changes narrow the gap, and why changes happen is critical for understanding gender convergence in domestic labor time. Drawing on data from the 2003-22 American Time Use Survey, we examine trends in core housework, occasional housework, shopping, and childcare time. Results for married women and men indicate that the historically large gender gap in housework time narrowed further this century, from a women-to-men ratio of 1.8:1 in 2003-05 to 1.5:1 in 2022. The decrease in the gender gap was concentrated in traditionally \u201cfeminine\u201d core housework (from 4.2:1 to 2.5:1), particularly in housecleaning and laundry. The gender gap in shopping time also narrowed significantly, reaching gender parity. However, the gender gap in childcare time remained at a mother-to-father ratio of 2:1. Decomposition analyses indicate that women\u2019s reduced housework time could mainly be explained by population compositional changes, whereas men\u2019s increased housework time reflected behavioral changes. With men taking on more \u201cfemale-typed\u201d domestic activities, the gendered norms associated with different types of domestic labor may be becoming redefined.",

    "link": "https://share.osf.io/preprint/E010E-3A8-AF0",
    "description": "Although Bangladesh has adopted many digital initiatives, it continues to grapple with widespread digital disparity and social inequality. Through semi-structured interviews, this study explores the dynamics of the digital divide and the perceptions and experiences of undergraduate students in Bangladesh in ICT education and learning. The findings indicate that, despite the significant impact of the digital divide, caused by multifaceted socioeconomic inequality, ICT education has largely failed to provide students with essential digital skills. This article emphasizes the need for an effective learning environment that prioritizes three interconnected dimensions: equal access, resources, and digital literacy. By examining the interplay between digital divides and the imperative of integrating e-learning into pedagogical strategies, this study contributes to the field of educational policy and technology. Ultimately, this article advocates a digitally inclusive and student-centred digital learning environment in the technology-poor setting of higher education in Bangladesh.",

    "description": "Although the organisational aspects of scholarly journals\u2014such as the types of organisations responsible for publishing individual journals, whether independently or in collaboration\u2014have significant implications for scholarly communication, they have received little focused research attention on a large scale. This study provides a comprehensive analysis of all WoS-indexed journals (N=21,886), focusing on the type of organisations that are officially attached to publishing the journals, either alone or together. We also investigate the disciplinary, geographical and linguistic diversity, and the key bibliometric characteristics, of journals (co)published by different types of organisations. By augmenting WoS metadata with a custom classification concerning organisational information about the journals publishing and governing organisations available through the International ISSN Centre, this study provides a larger and more detailed analysis than has been available so far. Our results show that 66% of journals are published by a sole organisation type (professional, research organisation, society), and 34% respectively are published through combinations of these different organisation types. The most common form of collaboration was a professional publisher with a scholarly society as the collaborative organisation.",

    "description": "The video game market is forecasted to be valued at $321.6 billion by 2027. Today, younger generations increasingly prefer spending their leisurely time playing online video games. Beyond providing a leisurely \u2013 and often competitive \u2013 activity to the bulk of its user base, online video games provide cybercriminals with an environment that is free from the reigns of legal enforcement. More specifically, with the growing popularity and uptake of the microtransaction business model, money launderers are provided with novel channels to move their illicitly gained funds. A continuously expanding body of evidence underscores that money laundering is occurring through online video games. Foremost, cybercriminals are attracted to the anonymity and global reach offered by online video games with few to no controls currently in place to disrupt laundering processes. Furthermore, regulations are struggling to keep pace with the latest money laundering strategies employed by cybercriminals. This paper explores and discusses money laundering in the context of online video games. Core vulnerabilities enabling money laundering to occur through online video games are identified. Security controls to reduce the scale of laundering are proposed.",

    "link": "https://share.osf.io/preprint/E003F-465-DC6",
    "description": "Do voters ``signal'' their decisions by voting early, or do they ``snipe'' by casting their votes at the last minute? In transparent sequential roll call voting, such as in the U.S. House of Representatives, voters can strategically choose when to cast their votes. This contrasts with the U.S. Senate's sequential voting, where the order is exogenously determined, or private simultaneous voting, as typically seen in elections. Despite the significance of these roll call votes in high-stakes decision-making, the potential for strategic behavior based on vote timing remains underexplored. This paper examines the causal effect of transparent sequential voting on voter decision timing, leveraging a natural experiment from roll call votes in a crypto startup (DAO), which transitioned from private one-stage voting to transparent sequential voting. I collected a dataset of individual-level voting records, delegated voting power, and precise vote timing. First, the fixed-effect regression analysis reveals that introducing a public tally in transparent sequential voting increases the likelihood of early voting (signaling) or last-minute voting (sniping) compared to the baseline of private simultaneous voting. This finding is consistent with game-theoretic predictions. Additionally, interaction models show that more pivotal voters, measured by the Shapley-Shubik index, are more likely to vote early rather than snipe at the last minute. These results suggest that a public tally may adversely affect welfare regarding information aggregation, as signaling strategies can intensify the influence of pivotal voters.",

    "description": "This paper presents novel empirical evidence on the impact of trade on structural transformation. Leveraging quasi-experimental tariff variation from Brazil's trade liberalization in the 1990s, we examine its effects on regional sectoral employment shares. Building on recent cross-regional macroeconomic literature, we approximate the aggregate effects of trade on structural change by extending the traditional shift-share analysis to include estimates of spatial spillover effects, beyond the commonly reported local or direct impacts. Our findings reveal that Brazilian regions directly exposed to larger tariff reductions experienced a significant decrease in manufacturing employment shares, an increase in the primary sector, and a decline in non-tradables. Spatial spillover effects\u2014whether based on migration or gravity links\u2014are positive for manufacturing and the primary sector but negative for non-tradables. While positive spillovers in manufacturing partially offset local deindustrialization, the net effects remain negative and economically significant. These effects persisted for at least twenty years post-liberalization and are independent of potential confounders, including alternative structural change hypotheses and other shocks to Brazil's economy during the study period. Our results are consistent with the theoretical literature on trade and structural transformation which emphasizes the significance of comparative advantage.",

    "link": "https://share.osf.io/preprint/E01AA-D1C-0E5",
    "description": "Since 2022, central bank losses have been prevalent in advanced economies due to previous quantitative easing and recent inflationary pressures. This paper focuses on the unique case of the United Kingdom, where the government promised in advance to cover any central bank losses arising from quantitative easing. This promise is known as the indemnity. A game-theoretical model is proposed to explain the causes and effects of such indemnity. The model's predictions about the indemnity's effect on central bank profitability are empirically examined. Using the novel Dynamic Multilevel Latent Factor Model (DM-LFM), the indemnity is found to have significantly boosted the Bank of England's profits in the deflationary environment after 2008, but exacerbated its losses under the recent inflationary pressure since 2022. The theoretical model suggests the pronounced effects are due to the Bank of England's high sensitivity to losses and the UK government's moderate fiscal liberalism. Therefore, the British experience should not be generalised. Nevertheless, the theoretical and empirical lessons can inform policy-makers about future institutional designs concerning the fiscal-monetary interactions and the public finance-price stability trade-off.",

    "description": "In recent decades, intensified human activities\u2014overfishing, marine pollution, and offshore energy exploitation\u2014have drastically altered marine ecosystems, inducing complex environmental and social challenges. The latter disproportionately impacts developing nations and vulnerable communities. While the law of the sea was originally designed to ensure peace, security, and legal order for the ocean, its facilitation of industrialized ocean exploitation has inadvertently contributed to widening inequality gaps. This paper leverages infrastructure studies to discuss the \"infrastructural work of law\" and explore how law\u2019s distributional effects perpetuate injustices in ocean governance. By analyzing case studies such as marine resource conservation and shipping regulations, the study illustrates how thinking of law through an infrastructural lens reveals its agency and its potential for harm in the global ocean polity. This perspective advances an understanding of ocean justice that accounts for the complex and multi-scalar dynamics required to address the unequal burdens of the Anthropocene.",

These barriers not only impede individual academic endeavors but also perpetuate systemic inequalities within the global academic community. Drawing from our own personal experiences, we discuss mobility barriers, exposing their structural, institutional, and personal dimensions.

    "description": "Over the past decades, attitudes toward mothers\u2019 roles have become more gender-egalitarian. There has been a concurrent increase in early childhood education and care (ECEC) participation rates across Europe. However, inequality in ECEC usage has remained. The main reason for the inequality has been found to be problems with accessing the service but it is argued that attitudes toward mother\u2019s role possible also play a role in it. This article examines the relationship between attitudes and ECEC usage at two points in time: 2008 and 2017. The article uses two data, EU-SILC and EVS, and the method multilevel logistic regression. The analysis considers both country-level and individual-level connections, reflecting on ECEC usage. The findings indicate an association between increasingly egalitarian attitudes and rising ECEC participation rates. As attitudes among less educated individuals change more slowly, their impact on ECEC usage could become more significant, particularly concerning inequality in ECEC usage. This is evident in the cross-level interaction between overall attitudes and mothers\u2019 education in predicting ECEC participation among children under three years old. The disparity in ECEC usage between the less educated and those with higher levels of education is growing.",

    "link": "https://share.osf.io/preprint/E0022-00C-D1E",
    "description": "The Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS) has established one of the most comprehensive free movement regimes. By declaring West Africa a borderless region, the organisation affirms the right of free movement for all citizens of member states. Nevertheless, significant obstacles to securing this right persist, resulting in difficulties moving across the region. These challenges are particularly prevalent for female migrants. Studies on free movement within West Africa reveal that widespread corruption, border harassment, and bureaucratic inefficiencies severely restrict female migration opportunities. However, current scholarship inadequately addresses the interrelation between regional mobility law, infrastructures, and female migration. This article argues that a fundamental issue within the ECOWAS free movement regime is ensuring access to mobility infrastructures. It examines the gendered dimensions of access to mobility infrastructures from the perspective of ECOWAS officials. Mobility infrastructures are conceptualised as comprising legal, physical, and technological components that collectively facilitate or restrict movement. The analysis draws on documentary evidence and insights from 19 semi-structured interviews with ECOWAS Commission officials. It shows that access to mobility infrastructures is predominantly determined by embedded gender norms, laws, and practices. By analysing accounts from officials involved in constructing the free movement regime, the article provides unique insights into the disparities between institutional intentions, legal frameworks, and mobility trajectories. In doing so, it contributes to research on free movement in West Africa, mobility infrastructures, and the emerging scholarship on legal infrastructures.",

    "link": "https://share.osf.io/preprint/E023E-BB6-0AD",
    "description": "This paper introduces a novel transaction-function model for valuing emerging markets, integrating machine learning, agent-based modeling, and multi-method valuation techniques. Traditional valuation models often rely on aggregated economic indicators such as GDP growth and inflation, which lack the granularity needed to capture the transactional dynamics and unique risk factors inherent to emerging markets. In contrast, the proposed model treats each market as a multi-dimensional function of individual transactions, analyzing these interactions through a multi-method framework that includes Discounted Cash Flow (DCF), comparables, precedent transaction, and multiples analysis. By incorporating machine learning algorithms, the model iteratively improves predictive accuracy, dynamically adjusting to new data in volatile and data-sparse environments. Additionally, agent-based simulations provide insights into behavioral responses to policy changes, regulatory shifts, and other market-specific conditions, offering a behavioral layer often missing from traditional approaches. Validation of this model demonstrates a marked improvement in predictive accuracy and adaptability compared to conventional models. This transaction-function approach provides investors and policymakers with a granular, data-driven tool for assessing the true growth potential of emerging markets, paving the way for more informed, context-sensitive investment decisions.",

Although a large body of literature has illustrated both gendered patterns in major choice as well as overall gender segregation across academic majors, comparatively less attention has been paid to an important building block for gender inequality: college courses. In this study, we examine the process of how students choose courses and the implications for gender segregation. Drawing on a unique data set that includes individual-level consideration and choice data from an entire cohort of university students choosing their first college courses, we examine both gender segregation at the college course level as well as the extent to which individual decision-making processes are themselves gendered. We find that course gender composition serves as a screener at the consideration stage, which suggests that gender segregation in decision-making emerges at the outset of the choice process. Once a subset of considered options has been established, final choices are much less influenced by course gender compositions. Furthermore, we find that courses are much more gender-segregated, on average, than majors themselves, illustrating that segregation is occurring at a more microlevel than commonly studied.",

    "description": "Free-ranging dogs are among the top global invasive species with major impacts on biodiversity and humans. Academicians in conservation or allied fields are at the forefront of investigating this conflict. But are their opinions impaired by their emotional attachment with dogs? We investigated this question through an online survey that reached 360 academicians across 139 institutions in India. We assessed the respondent's affinity towards dogs and their perception on their impacts, causes of this problem, suggestions on its mitigation and success of the mitigation measures. We found that although affinity towards dogs had no effect on respondent's perceptions of their impacts, their perceptions on the causes and suggested mitigation measures differed. Respondents who liked dogs suggested ineffective measures like reproductive control and mass adoption to mitigate their impacts, while also acknowledging that the suggested mitigation measures would never work due to multiple reasons. Through our results we show that academicians who are presumed to provide evidence-driven solutions opted for value-driven suggestions. This could be due to high consideration given to emotions in animal rights policies in the country. We interpret this contradiction using cognitive dissonance theory and suggest a need of encouraging a scientific temper of evidence-based mitigation measures.",

    "description": "Housing searches play a central role in the reproduction of racial inequality in U.S. cities. Past research finds that movers\u2019 social ties influence residential segregation, as renters receive information about homes located near friends and family. Fewer studies examine how renters\u2019 social ties also provide instrumental assistance during moves, or how this aid unequally shapes moving outcomes. In the present study, I show how 69 low-income, Latina/o and non-Hispanic white renters rely on their friends, family, and acquaintances to navigate moves in Los Angeles, a highly unaffordable rental market. Both groups mobilize their ties for instrumental assistance, but the resources available through renters\u2019 ties contribute to diverging search outcomes. Low-income Latina/o renters\u2019 ties, who also struggled to make ends meet, provided what I call constrained support\u2014referrals to open units, loans to cover moving costs, and informal rental opportunities. This assistance channeled movers to specific apartments and left them negotiating informal, doubled-up homes and new debt. In contrast, low-income white renters leveraged comparatively affluent ties to cosign leases, provide financial gifts, and strengthen applications across buildings\u2014what I refer to as flexible assistance. This aid helped low-income white movers secure housing advantages, while avoiding short-term reciprocal obligations to friends and family. These findings advance research on residential mobility and social support, and they show how network resource inequalities contribute to racial stratification in rental markets.",

    "link": "https://share.osf.io/preprint/E023E-AE5-61C",
    "description": "Black Pete (Zwarte Piet) is a blackface character at the center of the Dutch celebration of Sinterklaas (Saint Nicholas). The character has become an increasingly polarizing figure during the last few years in the Dutch public space. Those who oppose the figure argue that it promotes racial inequality and is an offensive reminder of an unjust past that exploited Black people through slavery and colonization. Meanwhile, those who defend the image maintain that the character bears no racial connotations but is an important part of a long-held, popular holiday celebrated by Dutch citizens, the majority of whom do not view themselves as racist. The fallout from the debate has seen an increase in incidents targeting Dutch citizens of African ancestry, particularly in the weeks preceding Sinterklaas celebrations. Incidents range from children being taunted as Black Pete to activists being humiliated with Black Pete caricatures. Finding a middle ground that recognizes both tradition and justice remains elusive as the debate reveals how some popular traditions can be instrumental for fueling discrimination against citizens based on ancestry. Notable in these debates is the emergence, and recent official abolishment, of two competing narratives on being Dutch: the autochtoon (of ethnic Dutch heritage) and the allochtoon (of foreign birth/foreign heritage). This paper argues against such polarizing narratives and instead advocates for justice and inclusivity in traditional practices that influence division. A positive option is a re-imagination of Pete that (a) critically interrogates how he is racially defined and depicted; and (b) deals away with the negative racial connotations associated with him. A re-imagined Pete potentially offers a powerful message that tradition can be upheld without denying justice to minority members of society.",

This qualitative research used thematic analysis to examine 30 storybooks on the environment & climate change authored by 10-15 year olds, to understand the portrayal of characters based on the environmental educators and activists the children had interacted with. Data from interviews, focus group discussions, student reflections and program blogposts were collected and coded to confirm understanding from the storybooks. Results show that in 12 of the books, the young authors had introduced protagonists, supporting characters or minor characters inspired by the environmental educators and activists they had interacted with. These characters were adults who were different from the other adults in the storybooks. They were first and foremost, Indian, were kind & caring, were experts who taught in child-friendly & democratic ways and created a proto-conscientization in the other characters in the books. This proto-conscientization included an understanding of systems of power and oppression which then fuelled political or community based action by the characters in the books. This was a significant contribution to the process of decolonizing eco and climate fiction where representations of people from the Global South is often missing or reductive.",

An unsupervised machine learning algorithm and a theoretical framework jointly identified abnormal behaviour, revealing that 11.25% of users exhibited confirmed inorganic behaviour. This indicates coordinated inauthentic activity, a common feature of disinformation campaigns, though the study does not explore any direct connection to RT or the Russian government.

    "description": "International drug trafficking dominates the conversation on organized crime, but equally common and serious are urban systems of organized crime\u2014criminal groups focused not on exports or transshipment, but on dominating local markets, neighborhoods, and politics. When policymakers do pay attention to this problem, they consistently make the same mistake\u2014believing there are best practices. But systems of organized crime are not all alike. There is no one blueprint or general solution, and so following the latest fad is unlikely to deliver the desired result. Instead of trying to copy the quasi-mythological success of a Giuliani or Bukele, policymakers need to understand what kind of organized crime problem they have, what capabilities their city possesses, and what tools are appropriate to the circumstances. This paper looks in-depth at how organized crime is organized in three cities: Chicago, Medell\u00edn, and San Salvador. It also considers New York, Bogot\u00e1, and Port-au-Prince. I argue that the primary driver of their organization and incentives is their source of criminal revenues. A second major driver of behavior is the degree of criminal political organization, which broadly-speaking takes three forms: atomized individuals, fragmented groups, and competing confederations. These forms are not just the product of their revenues, but are also the result of decades of competition with the state and one another. What policy tools will work hinges on this diagnosis. I look at the evidence for a range of standard policies\u2014from crackdowns to street outreach\u2014and explain why we can expect them to have wildly different impacts depending on the context.",

    "description": "A four-phase Hackathon of Educational Materials was constructed to enable instructors to take existing course materials and integrate, rather than concatenate, new content and activities. The \"integrate, not concatenate\" (InC) approach was pilot tested utilizing the Hackathon, with ethical reasoning content and activities to be integrated into courses in degree programs for mathematics, statistics, operations research, and data science in one undergraduate department. The InC Hackathon of Educational Materials phases for ethical reasoning coverage were: Hack 1 (H1): Take published learning outcomes about ethical reasoning and choose one or more that would be feasible in your course; Hack 2 (H2): Utilizing the learning outcomes of your specific course, determine if any can be revised to include \u201cethics\u201d ideas, and whether the syllabus communicates value for/importance of ethical practice; Hack 3 (H3): Determine where in the course (syllabus) the learning outcomes created in H1\u2013H2 fit best; and Hack 4 (H4): Design or revise assignments that will inform learners and instructors about whether the new/hacked learning outcomes (H1-H3) were achieved. The InC Hackathon of Educational Materials was scheduled over 1- and 2-hour blocks over three days totaling 8 hours during one week. Real-time feedback was collected in terms of clarity and feasibility of each Hack, and after the end of the Hackathon. Originally planned for 4-5 instructors working on one course, 14 instructors participated in some or all portions of the Hackathon, working on integrating ethical reasoning content into seven courses within three academic programs. All participants identified ethical content to integrate and worked to ensure that their courses would integrate different material and activities. Courses in sequence within an academic program were also hacked to introduce ethical content early, and develop more sophistication in later courses. Each program was able to develop achievable learning objectives for ethics content in each of the courses, and these were sequenced to support student growth throughout their program. After the Hackathon, participants deemed it feasible and clear, and all participants achieved the objectives of Hacks 1-3, but there was insufficient time to complete the work in Hack 4. More time was felt and demonstrated to be needed, as well as orientation by leadership at the start. Additional time at the end of the Hackathon should be dedicated to curriculum-wide alignment of the results of the hacks. This InC pilot was an empirical demonstration of a coherent, reproducible framework for making systemic and systematic changes to higher education curricula.",

Dove-tailing these two observations raised the question of whether the educational level of one\u2019s confidants also independently impacts an individual\u2019s political attitudes; however, this question has gotten hardly any attention. Therefore, we theorize and study the role of education in the core discussion network, including the question under what conditions the influence of our confidant\u2019s education on our political attitudes is especially strong. Empirically, we use a random intercept cross-lagged panel model to disentangle selection effects from the influence effects of interest. We find a small but robust influence effect of confidants\u2019 educational attainment on political attitudes of ego. However, confidants\u2019 influence does not depend on the degree of dyadic political discussion, confidant newness, and dyadic similarity.",

    "description": "Abortion is a safe and common medical procedure. Roughly one in four women in the United States will have an abortion before the end of her reproductive years. Because of how common this experience is and how rapidly abortion policy is shifting, understanding the relationship between abortion and women\u2019s socioeconomic futures is well worth exploring. Extant research has demonstrated that the transition to parenthood is a critical inflection point in women\u2019s socioeconomic trajectories, often leading to poorer outcomes. In this article, we connect previous sociological work elucidating mechanisms of socioeconomic stratification and gender by considering the relationship between abortion use and access and future socioeconomic outcomes such as education, income, and financial stability\u2014as measured by several measures, including evictions, debt, ability to pay bills, and a separate index of economic instability. We use national longitudinal survey data to assess socioeconomic outcomes associated with abortion using two statistical approaches. We find that women who lived in a location with fewer abortion restrictions in adolescence, and women who had an abortion, compared to a live birth, in adolescence, are more likely to have graduated from college, have higher incomes, and have greater financial stability at two time-points over an almost 25-year period. Our results provide evidence that policy environments allowing access to abortion, and teenagers having the option to use abortion to avoid early parenthood, are important axes along which women\u2019s economic lives are shaped. Our research implies that the widespread abortion bans and restrictions in the United States are likely to lead to lower educational attainment and adult economic stability among women living under such restrictions, as compared to women in locations with better access to abortion.",

    "description": "When managing multiple stores in the same marketplace, retailers need to select store locations and localize product assortments to reflect the heterogeneous demand preferences across communities. This paper introduces a consumer-centric data-driven framework for market structural interpretation and localized assortment planning. The framework involves a dynamic system, called the dual Poisson Dynamic System with Multilayer Factorization (dPDS-MF), for panel data on product assortments and individual consumer purchases across vending locations. The dPDS-MF can help retailers profile different consumer segments driven by store visit preferences, measure relationships between store locations, and simultaneously estimate product preferences for each consumer segment. The framework also uses these model outputs to derive localized assortment strategies. We apply our proposed framework to the retail vending market in major train stations in Japan. We showcase the face validity of the model outputs and the value of the dPDS-MF for guiding decisions on vending locations. We also demonstrate the localized assortments derived from our framework are much more meaningful than those from the standard strategy in the literature.",

Building on the distinction between three dimensions of scientization, it proposes an ideal type for one of them\u2014i.e., contributory scientization whereby policymaking institutions become active contributors to science. The article derives empirically observable characteristics for this ideal type, regarding leadership and staff profiles, use of internal resources, composition of external networks, and publication and discursive outputs. The BoE is then contrasted to this ideal type of a central bank thoroughly involved in contributory scientization. The empirical material includes archives and interviews as well as three databases providing quantitative information from the 1970s to 2019. We find that the degree of concordance with contributory scientization is strategically motivated, revealing tensions over time with factors such as balancing the imperatives of organizational credibility and informed policymaking, which are related to the other two dimensions of scientization. We thus conclude that scientization in central banks is a three-dimensional, non-linear process, rather than a steamroller.",

The article relies on the results of the contributions gathered by the special issue \u201cThe Scientization of Central Banks. National Patterns and Global Trends\u201d\u2014to which this article provides also an introduction. We start with an analysis of Martin Marcussen\u2019s concept of \u201cscientization\u201d, originally formulated to describe the changes within central banks since the 2000s. After highlighting how Marcussen\u2019s concept has raised different interpretations, we broaden our scope to examine how \u201cscientization\u201d is applied in the wider social sciences, extending beyond the study of central banks. This brings to the fore two ideas: scientization as \u201cboundary work\u201d (redrawing the line between \u201cscience\u201d and \u201cnon-science\u201d) happening both in the public-facing (\u201cfrontstage\u201d) and internal (\u201cbackstage\u201d) activities of organizations. Finally, we suggest how these two ideas can be used to reinterpret \u201cscientization\u201d of central banks as the emergence of central banks as \u201cboundary organizations\u201d. This reframing allows us to untangle and clarify the phenomena previously conflated under the original concept of scientization, offering a more coherent framework for ongoing research on central banks.",

It then puts this to the test empirically using a randomised field experiment with 29,008 households. It illustrates that rigorous testing of interventions is necessary to understand their impact across different democratic contexts: Contrary to what theory would predict for electoral contexts and paid-for work, all tested interventions significantly decrease participation in the governance initiative under study.

    "description": "The International Criminal Court (ICC) has come under challenge in recent years as some countries have decided, or considered, to withdraw from it. Against this backdrop, an emerging literature has begun to examine attitudes toward the court among the general public as a key court constituency. However, little is known about how domestic elites perceive the court. This research gap is particularly surprising given that domestic elites have a considerable impact on both public and state support of the court. This article explains why political and societal elites across world regions have confidence or lack confidence in the ICC. We present the results from a unique survey of 722 elite respondents conducted from 2017 to 2019 across six countries: Brazil, Germany, the Philippines, Russia, South Africa, and the United States. We furthermore enrich our analysis by using public opinion data to draw comparisons between elites and the general public. The analyses reveal that the views of elites are most consistently related to their perceptions of other, more well-known international organizations and their country\u2019s relationship with the ICC. Our findings indicate both similarities and differences between how elite and public opinion about the ICC are formed, demonstrating the value of further research on elite opinion on international courts.",

While this level of personalization can greatly benefit the user, recommended ads and content sometimes resemble aspects of the user's private lives that they may not have wanted the algorithm or platform to know. Moreover, though users show to dislike these experiences of privacy violations, they still engage in disclosure of private information with the system due to fatigue in managing online privacy altogether. This current study integrates Communication Privacy Management (CPM) theory (Petronio, 2002) into the human-algorithm interaction context to examine to what extent social media users (N = 1,305) allow co-ownership of private information with their algorithm depending on their felt privacy fatigue. Results from using latent moderated structural equations (LMS) suggest that individuals\u2019 algorithmic literacy significantly predicts their willingness to allow co-ownership of private information with social media algorithms. Additionally, contrary to previous literature, greater algorithmic awareness leads to less co-ownership for those most fatigued. Considering these findings, implications for future research for human-machine communication privacy management are discussed.",

    "link": "https://share.osf.io/preprint/E0219-D4B-6A7",
    "description": "Current federalism research is dominated by the successful American model, focusing on a territorialized, mono-national constitutional federalism, where individuals of different nations within a specific territorial scope are jointly subject to and protected by the state. However, this is not the only way federalism can address the coexistence of multiple nations. By reviewing historical figures and theoretical narratives, as well as incorporating contemporary federal theorists on plurality and multiracial coexistence, this study seeks to shed light on a non-territorialized alternative arrangement. Once, facing the complex national coexistence within the Austro-Hungarian Empire, Austrian Marxist Karl Renner proposed the personal principle and cultural autonomy, attempting to reshape the federal structure of the Austro-Hungarian Empire through a non-territorial arrangement. Renner reorganizes national communities as legal entities to act as intermediaries between individuals and the state, and to implement non-territorial economic, political, and cultural management for individuals of their own nations. This study also explores the model's non-territorial character, its treaty-based character, and its embodiment of federalism as norm. In Renner's view, this attempt could achieve a balance, avoiding both the oppression of minorities by the majority within territorial structures and the centrifugal tendencies of minority groups within specific territorial scopes. Although Renner's federalist reforms ultimately failed, they still provide valuable guidance for dealing with the political reality of multinational coexistence today, demonstrating the inherent potential of a non-territorial, pluralistic, treaty-based federalism.",

    "description": "In recent decades, white fundamentalist Christians became disproportionately affiliated with the Republican Party in the U.S. and some advocate Christian Nationalism. This study examines the association of religious commitment with an index of humanitarian progress and Republican vote percentage in 2012 and 2016 among U.S. states. The percentage of people who say they pray daily in a state strongly correlates with a lower humanitarian progress score and a higher percentage of votes for Trump. The correlations remained strong when other factors (gun ownership, ethnic segregation, and income per cost of living) were controlled statistically in a multiple regression analysis. The results suggest that reliance on the supernatural leads to neglect of the natural. Support of Trump whose dishonesty is legion and who employs the fascist tactic of blaming social problems on minorities seems anomalous with Christian ideology. Although many establishment Republicans warned against Trump, the strong correlation between the Trump vote in 2016 with the vote for the establishment Republican Mitt Romney in 2012 suggests that party members are enmeshed in mutually reinforcing social arrangements that are not conducive to support of humanitarian policies and resistance to fascist tactics.",

Fifty-one participants (70.37% female; Mean Age = 24.6) took part in six online focus groups, viewing two randomly selected deepfakes of deceased artists. Thematic analysis, using a phenomenological approach, identified primarily intellectual reactions, with two key layers: first-order evaluations of realism and second-order societal impact assessments. These impacts spanned micro (individuals), meso (content creators/distributors), and macro (society-wide) levels. While cognitive and ethical concerns were prominent, emotional responses were fewer, often expressing discomfort or surprise. Findings offer valuable insights for the digital media industry and regulators in understanding public reception of deepfake technology.",

    "description": "This research applies Uses and Gratifications theory to examine individual motivations for sharing or not sharing deepfakes. After characterizing popular deepfakes in five genres (two examples each), 1035 US participants (42% female; Age: M = 42.8, SD = 14.1, Mdn = 41, Range = 18\u201393) watched one of the ten deepfakes and completed a questionnaire in Prolific. Results show that most participants would not share the deepfakes due to a lack of personal relevance. However, those who did intend to share them had hedonistic motivations, mostly enjoyment and the desire to share entertainment with others. The genre of these deepfakes also influenced motivations to share, with political deepfakes being a particularly specific case, and one where gender also had a greater impact. Women avoid sharing inaccurate information to a greater extent and men are more inclined to protect their image in social circles. Overall, this research highlights how audiences dynamically relate to deepfakes and offers insights into the psychological aspects of their relationships with this emerging media form. It also underscores the significance of the perceived entertainment value of deepfakes in their virality.",

    "description": "Inclusion is a process through which society and education collaborate to value people's differences, recognize their abilities, and restructure their organization by utilizing various technological resources to bring out the potential of each individual. This paper outlines and discusses how the Lesson Study professional development methodology, grounded in the Constructionist, Contextualized, and Meaningful (CCM) approach, along with the Universal Design for Learning (UDL) framework, can support teachers in promoting inclusive education. It presents the theoretical assumptions and the pathways researchers have taken to train future teachers, support educators' continuous professional development in the Brazilian context, and build inclusive education through educational actions, academic initiatives, and scientific research. The study suggests that the combined use of Lesson Study and the CCM approach, supported by the UDL framework, fosters effective inclusive teaching practices that address the diverse needs of all students within inclusive educational settings. Furthermore, the results demonstrate that the intentional integration of CCM approach and UDL as facilitative conceptual frameworks, alongside using Lesson Study as an iterative process for professional development, establishes the conditions necessary for inclusive education to flourish.",

    "description": "Over the past ten years or so, concern has mounted about places in the Global North that have been \u2018left behind\u2019 by the growth and prosperity experienced in superstar cities and other wealthy regions. This briefing paper summarises the findings from the one of the strands of the \u2018Beyond Left Behind Places\u2019 project, which involved quantitative analysis of residential migration patterns in economically \u2018left behind\u2019 regions in the UK, France, and Germany during the immediate pre-COVID period. In addition, we conducted qualitative research with residents of economically \u2018left behind\u2019 regions in the three countries to get their perceptions. We use national administrative and census data for the three countries to examine whether economically lagging regions tend to lose or gain population through migration, and what age groups are moving in or out. Economic theories often assume that individuals migrate from economically lagging regions to areas offering better economic conditions. But actually, economically lagging regions in the UK, France and Germany generally tend to experience net population inflows. In other words, more people are moving to these regions than are moving out. In fact, when it comes to internal migration (i.e. people moving within the same country), these lagging regions tend to attract more new residents, on average, than more economically successful regions do.",

    "link": "https://share.osf.io/preprint/E003C-28B-590",
    "description": "Street names are not neutral identifiers to navigate through cities but are charged with strong symbolic connotations and reflect power relations within society. A growing body of geographic scholarship documents a strong gender bias in the urban namespace, where women only represent a small fraction of streets named after people. This article investigates whether the lack of women in political decision-making roles contributes to explaining their marginalization in urban toponyms. More specifically, we study the impact of the gender and ideology of town mayors on their decisions to commemorate women in the street map. Focusing on the universe of Spanish towns during the period 2001-2023, we find through fixed effects panel data models and regression discontinuity design that the mayor\u2019s gender does not affect the percentage of female-named streets, while the ideology of the governing party does. Our findings thus indicate that it is ideology rather than gender what shapes politicians\u2019 preferences regarding the commemoration of women in the street map. We argue that this is because, on the one hand, strong political parties can impose their agenda on local leaders, making irrelevant differences in their gender and, on the other, the ideological cleavage is more relevant than the gender one to account for differences in attitudes towards symbolic gender policies. A natural implication of our results is that simply having more female politicians will hardly suffice to address the gender gap in street names and in other symbolically charged policies.",

    "description": "International investment arbitration is inhabited by actors who theorize the law as scholars and decide on it when arbitrating, which raises critical questions concerning their normative role within the legal system. This article explores empirically the influence of legal scholars on the development of inter?national investment law through a combined legal-empirical and sociological approach designed to capture the multidirectional nature of influence. It relies on a novel database of all citations to legal scholarship in International Centre for the Settlement of Disputes (ICSID) case law, which is analysed quantitatively and qualitatively and contextualized alongside interviews with 16 leading arbitrators and lawyers. The article firstly introduces the arbitrator/academic as an agent of international law, and then details the methodology.

The following parts show how legal scholarship influenced the development of the definition of an \u2018investment\u2019 in ICSID arbitration through an analysis of legal decisions and scholarship authored by arbitrators. The final part goes into conversation with the actors to further unravel how they manage competing and complementary obligations towards theory and practice, and the article concludes by reflecting on the ethical implications of their law-making function.",

    "link": "https://share.osf.io/preprint/E003B-559-1AE",
    "description": "This study investigates factors driving attitudes towards voluntary return intentions among Ukrainian displaced people. Using a vignette experiment (N = 384; Observations = 1,102) to manipulate home country conditions, we find that, as expected, the most crucial driver for return intention is the presence of peace in the home country. Conversely, economic and social conditions commonly outlined in the general migration literature have little to no effect on return intentions of forcibly replaced individuals. However, we also demonstrate that not all forms of peace are equally convincing; a \"punishing\" peace, associated with significant territorial loss, resembles an ongoing state of war and thus discouraging refugees from returning. Similarly, while peace itself does improve return intentions, so does greater integration into the international community. Our paper thus demonstrates that the conditions facilitating return are more nuanced than commonly discussed, and that not all forms of peace are seen as equal.",

    "description": "This study examines the movement against \u201cprogressive\u201d prosecutors in the United States. Prosecutors have significant discretion at the front-end of the criminal legal system, including over charges, bail recommendations, and plea deals. Although prosecutors have traditionally wielded their power in a way that contributes to mass incarceration, \u201cprogressive\u201d prosecutors have been elected in growing numbers since 2016 on pledges to mitigate the racialized harms of the criminal legal system. While scholars tie the rise of progressive prosecutors to the Movement for Black Lives (BLM), less is known about the countermovements efforts \u2013 such as recalls, impeachments, and suspensions \u2013 challenging these prosecutors\u2019 discretion and tenures. To address this gap, I constructed an original database of all local prosecutors in 2012 and/or 2022 in the country's 300 most-populous jurisdictions. Through archival research, I documented prosecutor demographics, state politics, and unusual opposition, which I define as organized efforts to remove prosecutors from office or constrain their power outside of regularly-scheduled elections. Findings reveal that unusual opposition disproportionately targets women of color prosecutors, disproportionately occurs in Republican-controlled states, and has nearly tripled over the last decade. I argue that unusual opposition is a novel movement repertoire used by the political right to legally mobilize against racial justice efforts following BLM.",

    "description": "Several transnational corporations, investors, international organizations and philanthropies have formed coalitions to respond to global social and environmental challenges. Do these coalitions, consisting of large-scale actors, have the capacities to contribute to the transformations that are needed, or do they perpetuate the same system dynamics that created the problem in the first place? We investigate this question by comparing publicly available information for five coalitions working with financial and food systems sustainability. This paper examines whether large-scale actor coalitions (LSACs) may contribute to transformations towards equitable and sustainable futures. We use a \u2018rapid assessment\u2019 20-variable framework to collect and analyze empirical data from five food and finance coalitions to identify their roles and capacities for transformative change. Our results indicate that LSACs implement distinct strategies to reach their goals. More specifically, due to their diverse set-ups, LSACs have the ability to raise awareness of sustainability issues, utilize ties to push forward agendas, experiment with solutions and showcase promising niche initiatives. We examine strategies undertaken by LSACs that can enable other change makers working to transform the food and finance systems, contributing to systems with high and diverse capacities for transformative change. We also identify potential capacity gaps within the studied LSACs, which might hinder the creation of enabling conditions for transformative change within the food and finance sectors.",

    "description": "A large body of research addresses whether and how parental partnership quality affects child wellbeing. While much of this research has focused on nuclear families, less is known about patterns in stepfamilies. This study adopts a dyadic perspective to explore how parental partnership quality relates to the wellbeing of children living with both biological parents versus those with a biological parent and a stepparent. We apply multivariable linear regression and a mediation analysis on longitudinal data from the German Panel Analysis of Intimate Relationships and Family Dynamics (pairfam) to understand the relationship between family structure, step- and biological parent\u2019s partnership quality and children\u2019s self-reported wellbeing, operationalised over the Strength and Difficulties questionnaire (SDQ-scores). The analytical sample includes children who live in heterosexual couple households (n=1,781). We differentiate two separate dimensions of parental partnership quality, namely the frequency of conflict and esteem between the (step-)parents. Results show that children living with a stepparent exhibit higher total difficulties score compared to children living with both their biological parents. However, parental conflict occurs less and esteem more frequently in stepfamilies than in nuclear families. Mediation analysis indicates that partnership quality partially mediates the impact of family structure on SDQ scores. Our analysis suggests that the negative effect of living with stepparents on children\u2019s behavioural problems is slightly mitigated by increased parental esteem and lower conflict in these unions.",

In aligning this insight with current understandings of homophily, we identify and address several open questions about the origins of race homophily\u2014namely regarding the possibility of peer influence on racial identity and network selection based on multiple facets of race. Data are from 3,036 youth in two large U.S. high schools with sizable proportions of mixed-race students. Using a stochastic actor-oriented model, we find that students choose friends based on similarity across multiple dimensions of racial identity and that peer influence operates to reinforce multiracial youths&#8217; racial self-classification rather than to induce change. This points to a system where race homophily arises through multiple selection mechanisms and is reinforced by pressure toward conformity.",

    "link": "https://share.osf.io/preprint/E015D-978-AD2",
    "description": "An examination of public space provides insights into the disconnection between regulation and reception within the Parisian context. The visibility of refugees in public spheres has been instrumental in heightening civic consciousness in Paris. Simultaneously, it serves as a subject of political apprehension and an opportunity for the display of state-inflicted violence by humanitarian NGOs, too. The governance of public open spaces extends beyond traditional command and control approaches, emphasizing delegation, integration of new knowledge and technologies, negotiation, and self-regulation. The central concern involves an evolving, albeit ambiguous and partially contradictory, process of outsourcing certain aspects of reception policies without a well-experienced governance mode (Artioli, Le Gal\u00e8s, 2023). The first section describes the relevant social geography of Paris. Social transformations due to deindustrialization have left a lasting impact, concentrating immigrant populations in areas marked by blue-collar workers and social housing estates. While Paris actively engages in social and redistributive policies, achieving a balanced geographical distribution for diverse social groups remains a challenge. The ensuing section delineates the social policy responsibilities of both central and local institutions, against the backdrop of which the handling of refugees has transformed into a separate specific policy domain. Despite ongoing collaboration in Paris, challenges endure due to the stance of the French government and the inadequate coordination within the EU. The following three sections analyse the role of space in framing the reception policies of Paris, paying reference to different ways of framing the space: - The so-called \u2018Project Territories\u2019 of the EU Structural Funds exhibit a progressive drift where coalitions of territorial actors reinterpret national rules following their competencies (and expertise). - Locally managed reception comes to a standstill in the face of state normative injunctions. - Government authorities and local actors consciously use space for repressive purposes, even to manage conflicts between potentially incompatible uses. The conclusions deal with the evolving landscape of local reception policies driven by state and non-state actors. Despite innovative efforts, there is a lack of coherence, and central dispersion policies (Dollet, 2023) contradict local commitments, raising questions about the role of local governance. However, the cyclical coming and going between the dismantling of refugee camps and sheltering asylum seekers question the notion and scope of integration, highlighting the porous boundary between formal and informal regulations. Besides, the design of policies cannot underestimate the role of space in shaping welcoming practices.",

    "description": "Background: There is an internationally accepted discourse on \u2018Female Genital Mutilation\u2019 which understands it as a human rights violation, a major health concern, and an extreme form of gendered violence. Since the 1980s, African women, postcolonial feminists and anthropologists have critiqued this discourse as ethnocentric and racist. Aims: We examine the genealogy of the hegemonic anti-FGM discourse, identify alternative perspectives and analyse the extent to which they were integrated, co-opted, disregarded or silenced. Materials and methods: This genealogy draws upon a comprehensive review of the literature critiquing the dominant discourse on FGM, supplemented through analyses of British Colonial Office correspondence, documents from the (Parliamentary) \u2018Committee for the Protection of Coloured Women in the Crown Colonies\u2019, Church Missionary Society periodicals, debates in the UK Houses of Parliament, and UN (including WHO) reports and meeting minutes. Results: Alternative perspectives on female circumcision and critiques of the dominant narrative have been formulated throughout the history of the anti-FGM campaign. However, they have been silenced through various silencing mechanisms, and thus not permeated the hegemonic discourse. Outrage and backlash continue as silencing mechanisms around two contentious topics that embody colonial double standards: medicalised female circumcision and adult women\u2019s right to choose female circumcision.",

    "description": "The study of radicalization encompasses a broad spectrum of perspectives, with scholars and experts from diverse disciplines \u2013 ranging from psychology, sociology, political science, criminology, to economics \u2013 contributing to its multifaceted comprehension. Despite this substantial body of empirical research, the knowledge is fragmented across disciplines, emphasizing the need for integration to establish a cohesive framework. As laying the groundwork for a unified framework begins with identifying relevant phenomena, this systematic review analyzed 4019 research articles using text mining to detect phenomena associated with radicalization. Author keywords and s were analyzed by examining term frequency as an indicator of relevance and term co-occurrence as an indicator of association. The results reflect themes commonly featured in theory, such as ideology, identity, and social networks, but also identified themes not well-developed in theory. Macro-level phenomena, including the role of the state, economy, elections, policy, and regional factors, as well as micro- and meso-level phenomena like the internet, social media, adolescence, personality, language, education, and mental health, are not sufficiently embedded in theory. The findings further provide the first empirical evidence confirming the fragmentation of research on radicalization.

    "description": "Agriculture based economy makes the rural areas important in south-east Asia. Lack of accessibility to certain services were observed in countries like, Pakistan, Bangladesh, India etc. As a result, rural-urban migration became a regular practice. Though spatial dimension of accessibility was studied, non-spatial dimension was mostly unexplored for access to education, healthcare, food and modern agricultural services. So, with ten villages of Bangladesh as study area, 452 questionnaire surveys, 22 FGDs and 27 KIIs were conducted to understand the problems behind lack of access to these services. Different statistical tests, and qualitative comparison suggested that non-farm activities were more sustainable for households, and provided more access to services than fully farmingbased households. Some services were available, but inaccessible to the local people due to mismanagement. Livelihood diversification through collaboration of community and women empowerment could be the sustainable solutions for ensuring proper service accessibility in developing countries.",

    "title": "The Power of Fragmented Elites: The Role of Inadvertent Robust Action",
    "link": "https://share.osf.io/preprint/E019B-BB1-46E",
    "description": "It is broadly accepted among political scientists, political sociologists, and social movement theorists that a unified group will have a higher probability of success than a group that experiences internal divisions or fragmentation. Similarly, it has been assumed that in a society with a relatively unified elite, the elite will experience disproportionately higher benefits relative to the larger population. We take issue with this claim. In the mid-twentieth century, large American corporations exhibited a relatively high level of unity but the relative economic benefits accruing to the elite were at historic lows. In more recent years, American big business has become increasingly fragmented, yet the economic benefits that these elites have received have reached historic highs, and the average American\u2019s standard of living has stagnated. Drawing on Padgett and Ansell, we introduce the concept of inadvertent robust action to explain how a relatively fragmented, disorganized elite can reap benefits that exceed those that its more unified counterparts experienced in an earlier era. We conclude with a discussion of the conditions under which our formulation can be expected to hold.",

    "title": "Gendered Pathways: How do STEM Majors Fare in the Labor Market?",
    "link": "https://share.osf.io/preprint/E0142-D04-8CD",
    "description": "Although research in the STEM field has extensively examined its gendered characteristics, the vast majority of the literature has concentrated on educational transitions and young adults. More limited attention has been devoted to the longer-term work-family trajectories of STEM majors, and how these are linked to gender earnings gaps. In response, we exploit Finnish register data to identify the most common work-family trajectories followed by college educated men and women with STEM majors in ages 30\u201340 (N=150,796). Given marked differences in gender proportions across STEM fields, we distinguish computer science and engineering majors from natural science majors. In a second step, we assess gender differences in the returns to distinct work-family trajectories and within-gender differences. We report three main findings. First, women are able to combine a career in computer science and engineering and having children. Second, across occupations, mothers earn considerably less than fathers. This suggests that even though women can combine work and family, they do not benefit in terms of earnings. Third, beyond uncovering gender gaps, we show that a major mechanism underlying parental gender gaps is that men receive notable fatherhood premiums across work trajectories. For women, findings reveal more heterogeneous patterns. Among computer science and engineering majors, women have similar earnings across trajectories. Conversely, women with natural science majors gain from working in computer science and engineering.",

    "title": "Indigenous people's mobility and its impact on remote infrastructural needs: an exploratory study",
    "link": "https://share.osf.io/preprint/E01D6-236-9F5",
    "description": "With Indigenous populations at risk of higher rates of infection and more serious disease than non-Indigenous populations, a policy of returning to remote communities (i.e. Return to Country) was encouraged during the COVID-19 pandemic. This policy led to high expectations for remote communities to meet the often diverse and complex needs of returnees, placing further strain on existing, underfunded remote community infrastructure and services. This research explores mobility patterns of Indigenous people living on Country and its impact on the planning of housing, infrastructure and services within remote communities. Temporary mobility, that is movement that does not involve a change of usual residence, is caused by a wide range of factors, such as people\u2019s participation in cultural business or attendance at funerals, travel due to school holidays and seasonal weather patterns, participation in sport and leisure activities or to access alcohol outside the community. Factors affecting longer-term population mobility include access to housing, infrastructure, services and employment; family conflict and violence; and community unrest. The research finds increased and improved housing is required for many remote communities. In addition to reducing existing levels of crowding, communities experiencing population growth need to be more clearly identified so as to reduce concerns in the future. Essential infrastructure, such as power and water, must also be improved to support the development of new community housing. In addition, services such as government health support and education systems need to take into account Indigenous people\u2019s mobility patterns, particularly across state and territory borders. Enhanced collaboration between schools will enable students to continue with their education even when they are away from their home community, all of which would lead to better education outcomes for young Indigenous people.",

    "title": "What is 'high-risk research'? Comparing the social sciences and humanities and the natural sciences",
    "link": "https://share.osf.io/preprint/E017B-D3D-5C0",
    "description": "Although high-risk research is a key concern for research policy and science studies, there is little knowledge about what funding agencies or researchers mean by risks. This paper draws on 80 grant proposals from the social sciences and humanities (SSH) and the natural sciences (NSC) that have been submitted to the Reinhart Koselleck funding program of the German Research Foundation. The qualitative analysis shows both similarities and differences in how applicants in the two fields claim risks: in both fields, the most prominent notions refer to results and methodologies. While results at risk are interpreted similarly, methodological risks differ between the two fields. The analysis also reveals a greater variety of different risks in the SSH compared to the NSC. The paper suggests that research policy and science studies should avoid treating \u201criskiness\u201d as a given and consider different notions of risk across a disciplinary spectrum that includes the SSH.",
